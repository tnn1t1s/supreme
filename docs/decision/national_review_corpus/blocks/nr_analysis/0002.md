# The Court Got It Right on Tariff Authority
Author: Ed Whelan
Section: Bench Memos

## Claims
- [textual] The statutory holding correctly limits executive tariff authority to parameters Congress explicitly set.
- [historical] Congress's delegation under IEEPA was never intended to authorize broad trade policy restructuring.
- [institutional] The major questions doctrine properly constrains agencies from claiming vast authority from ambiguous grants.

## Assumptions
- Congressional delegation frameworks should be interpreted narrowly
- The executive branch has historically overstepped on trade authority
- Judicial review of executive trade actions is constitutionally necessary

## Tensions and Flags
- Treats the plurality major questions reasoning as if it were a holding
- Does not address the dissent's historical delegation evidence
