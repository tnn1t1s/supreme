# Why Trump's Section 122 Tariffs Are Illegal
Author: Andrew C. McCarthy
Section: The Corner

## Claims
- [textual] The Section 122 tariffs are more clearly illegal than the IEEPA tariffs because the statutory precondition — a large and serious balance-of-payments deficit — does not exist.
- [economic] Trump conflates the balance of trade with the balance of payments, which are distinct economic concepts; the U.S. has no overall balance-of-payments deficit.
- [historical] Section 122 was enacted to address a specific historical crisis under the Bretton Woods system and those conditions no longer obtain in the modern floating-dollar economy.
- [textual] The president has no inherent tariff authority and must meet the statutory preconditions Congress set in Section 122, which he cannot satisfy.
- [institutional] Congressional Republicans are derelict in exercising oversight of executive tariff abuse because they only care about rule of law when Democrats hold the White House.
- [institutional] The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in Learning Resources was correct, easily foreseeable, and grounded in bedrock separation of powers principles.

## Assumptions
- The statutory text of Section 122 must be read narrowly against its Bretton Woods historical context
- Balance of payments and balance of trade are legally distinct concepts that courts will enforce
- The dollar's reserve currency status and strong capital inflows definitively negate any balance-of-payments crisis claim
- Congressional dereliction does not expand executive power — the constitutional structure still constrains
- The Court's IEEPA ruling establishes a framework that makes Section 122 tariffs even harder to defend

## Tensions and Flags
- Assumes courts will apply the same skepticism to Section 122 as to IEEPA, but Section 122 has never been litigated in this context
- Does not engage with possible executive arguments that modern trade deficits constitute balance-of-payments problems under a broader reading
- Treats congressional inaction as pure dereliction rather than considering it as implicit tolerance of executive trade action
- Strong normative framing (presidential attacks are 'unmitigated disgrace') may reduce analytical weight of legal claims
