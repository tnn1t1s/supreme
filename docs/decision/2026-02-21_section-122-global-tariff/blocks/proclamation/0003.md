As my advisors have informed me, the United States runs a substantial trade deficit. The large, persistent, and serious annual United States goods trade deficit has grown by over 40 percent in the past 5 years alone, reaching $1.2 trillion in 2024. In 2025, the United States goods trade deficit remained at approximately $1.2 trillion. The effects of this deficit are serious, and this deficit contributes to the fundamental international payments problems facing the United States.

As my advisors have also informed me, the annual balance on the United States primary income turned negative for the first time since at least 1960 in 2024. From 1960 to 2023, the United States ran a surplus in its annual balance on primary income. That positive balance on primary income served as a stabilizing force for the United States balance-of-payments position even in the face of large and persistent trade deficits. In 2024, however, the balance on primary income turned negative and thus ceased to serve as a counterweight to the trade deficit in the United States current account. Indeed, in 2024, the United States maintained a current account deficit of 4.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), almost double the current account deficit of approximately 2.0 percent that prevailed between 2013 and 2019, and larger than that which prevailed from 2019 to 2023. As a share of GDP, the staggering deficit of 4.0 percent represented the biggest annual current account deficit since 2008.

As my advisors have also informed me, the net international-investment position of the United States is in an ongoing decline. According to the BEA, at the end of 2024, the net international-investment position of the United States, as a share of GDP, was negative 90 percent, a sharp deterioration from the average of negative 41 percent in the decade between 2010 and 2020. In my advisors’ view, this is a highly atypical position for a country, particularly the United States. Indeed, both in terms of United States dollars and as a share of GDP, this represents one of the most negative net international-investment positions of any developed country. Because the current account is one of the primary drivers of changes in the net international-investment position, the atypically large negative net international-investment position of the United States shows that the United States balance-of-payments deficit is large and serious.

Further, as my advisors have informed me, the balance on secondary income of the United States has been persistently in a deficit since the 1960s.

According to my advisors, an import surcharge in the form of ad valorem duties is required to address these fundamental international payments problems. In my advisors’ opinions, imposing an import surcharge would deal with the large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficit. My advisors have further recommended that certain products should not be subject to the surcharge because of the needs of the United States economy and have opined that a surcharge with certain exceptions would more effectively deal with the balance-of-payments deficit than would a surcharge without the exceptions.
