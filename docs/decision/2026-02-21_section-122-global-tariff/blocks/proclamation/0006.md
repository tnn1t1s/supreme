I find that each exception described in paragraph 14 of this proclamation — in whole or in part, separately or in any combination — is consistent with the limitations of section 122. These exceptions, which are further detailed in Annexes I and II to this proclamation, reflect my determination that each product covered by each exception should not be subject to a surcharge because of (1) the unavailability of domestic supply at reasonable prices, the necessary importation of raw materials, the avoidance of serious dislocations in the supply of imported goods, or other similar factors; or (2) the fact that the surcharge would be unnecessary or ineffective in carrying out the purposes of section 122, such as with respect to articles already subject to import restrictions or goods in transit, which — for purposes of this proclamation — are goods that (i) were loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit prior to entry into the United States, before 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 24, 2026; and (ii) are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time, February 28, 2026. I have determined that each exception described in paragraph 14 of this proclamation — in whole or in part, separately or in any combination — is consistent with the purposes of section 122 and will best serve the purposes of section 122. Each of my determinations to except an import from the surcharge imposed in this proclamation is independent from the other. The import-restricting action and the exceptions in this proclamation are not made for the purpose of protecting individual domestic industries from import competition.

In my judgment, the surcharge imposed in this proclamation is consistent with the purposes of section 122, the national interest of the United States, and the needs of the economy of the United States. Restricting imports through the surcharge imposed in this proclamation is required to address the fundamental international payments problems within the meaning of section 122 that I have found to exist. The surcharge imposed in this proclamation will deal with the large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficit.
