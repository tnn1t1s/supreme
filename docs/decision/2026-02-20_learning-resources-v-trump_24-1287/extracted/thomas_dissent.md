APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
I join JUSTICE KAVANAUGH’s principal dissent in full. As
he explains, the Court’s decision today cannot be justified
as a matter of statutory interpretation. Congress author-
ized the President to “regulate . . . importation.” 50 U. S. C.
§1702(a)(1)(B). Throughout American history, the author-
ity to “regulate importation” has been understood to include
the authority to impose duties on imports. Post, at 9–13,
22–29 (). The meaning of that
phrase was beyond doubt by the time that Congress enacted
this statute, shortly after President Nixon’s highly publi-
cized duties on imports were upheld based on identical lan-
guage. Post, at 14–22. The statute that the President relied
on therefore authorized him to impose the duties on imports

at issue in these cases. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH makes clear
that the Court errs in concluding otherwise.
I write separately to explain why the statute at issue here
is consistent with the separation of powers as an original
matter. The Constitution’s separation of powers forbids
Congress from delegating core legislative power to the Pres-
ident. This principle, known as the nondelegation doctrine,
is rooted in the Constitution’s Legislative Vesting Clause
and Due Process Clause. Art. I, §1; Amdt. 5. Both Clauses
forbid Congress from delegating core legislative power,
which is the power to make substantive rules setting the
conditions for deprivations of life, liberty, or property. Nei-
ther Clause prohibits Congress from delegating other kinds
of power. Because the Constitution assigns Congress many
powers that do not implicate the nondelegation doctrine,
Congress may delegate the exercise of many powers to the
President. Congress has done so repeatedly since the
founding, with this Court’s blessing.
The power to impose duties on imports can be delegated.1
At the founding, that power was regarded as one of many
——————
1I refer to charges on imported goods as “duties,” not “tariffs” or
“taxes.” When the government charged money for importing goods, that
charge was historically called a custom or impost, each of which was a
kind of “duty.” See N. Webster, A Compendious Dictionary of the English
Language 75, 152 (1806); Art. I, §10, cl. 2. The word “tariff ” primarily
referred to the schedule or table listing such duties, not the duties them-
selves. Webster, Compendious Dictionary, at 305. The word “tax,” alt-
hough sometimes used loosely to refer to all kinds of monetary charges,
more often “exclude[d]” duties on imports. R. Natelson, What the Con-
stitution Means by “Duties, Imposts, and Excises”—and “Taxes” (Direct
or Otherwise), 66 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 297, 306 (2015).
In fact, although Colonial Americans “staunchly contested efforts by
Parliament to ‘tax’ them,” they often “conceded the authority of the Brit-
ish government to regulate commerce through financial exactions,” in-
cluding “prohibitory tariffs.” Ibid. In the most “widely read” and “uni-
versally approved” response to the Stamp Act, E. Morgan & H. Morgan,
The Stamp Act Crisis 71 (1953), Daniel Dulany wrote: “A Right to impose
an internal Tax on the Colonies, without their Consent for the single

powers over foreign commerce that could be delegated to
the President. Power over foreign commerce was not within
the core legislative power, and engaging in foreign com-
merce was regarded as a privilege rather than a right.
Early Congresses often delegated to the President power to
regulate foreign commerce, including through duties on im-
ports. As I suggested over a decade ago, the nondelegation
doctrine does not apply to “a delegation of power to make
rules governing private conduct in the area of foreign
trade,” including rules imposing duties on imports. Depart-
ment of Transportation v. Association of American Rail-
roads, 575 U. S. 43, 80–81, n. 5 (2015) (opinion concurring
in judgment). Therefore, to the extent that the Court relies
on “‘separation of powers principles’” to rule against the
President, ante, at 8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.), it is mis-
taken.
I
The nondelegation doctrine is rooted in both the Legisla-
tive Vesting Clause and the Due Process Clause. The doc-
trine ensures that “[t]he Legislative [Branch] cannot trans-
fer the Power of Making Laws to any other hands.” J.
Locke, Two Treatises of Government §141, p. 380 (P. Laslett
ed. 1964) (Locke) (emphasis deleted). Importantly,
——————
Purpose of Revenue, is denied; a Right to regulate their Trade without
their Consent is admitted. The Imposition of a Duty, may, in some In-
stances, be the proper Regulation.” Considerations on the Propriety of
Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies 34 (2d ed. 1765) (emphasis de-
leted). Likewise, Benjamin Franklin famously conceded Britain’s “right
‘of laying duties to regulate commerce,’ ” but rejected its power to “ ‘lay
internal taxes.’ ” B. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Rev-
olution 214 (1967); see also id., at 212 (explaining that colonists denied
Britain “all right to tax the colonies,” but “conceded to it the right to raise
revenue through duties on trade”); E. Nelson, The Royalist Revolution
32 (2014); C. Becker, The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the
History of Political Ideas 90 (1922).

however, the nondelegation doctrine applies only to Con-
gress’s core legislative power, not to all of its powers.
A
The Legislative Vesting Clause grants Congress alone
the federal legislative power. It requires that “[a]ll legisla-
tive Powers” granted to the Federal Government “shall be
vested in a Congress of the United States.” Art. I, §1. It
follows that those federal legislative powers cannot be exer-
cised by anyone else, including the President. See Associa-
tion of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 74 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.).
“Legislative power” for purposes of the Vesting Clause
means the power to make substantive rules setting the con-
ditions for deprivations of life, liberty, or property. I have
described this power as the “core legislative power” to dis-
tinguish it from other powers that the Constitution grants
Congress. Id., at 80. Core legislative power includes only
the power to make “law” in the “Blackstonian sense of gen-
erally applicable rules of private conduct,” the violation of
which results in the deprivation of “core private rights.” Id.,
at 73, 76. These core private rights are the natural rights
to life, liberty, and property. See 1 W. Blackstone, Com-
mentaries on the Laws of England 123–136 (1765) (Black-
stone); C. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches,
107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 566–567 (2007).
The nondelegation doctrine is also rooted in the Due Pro-
cess Clause. That Clause prohibits the Federal Govern-
ment from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” Amdt. 5. The Founders mod-
eled it on chapter 39 of the Magna Carta, which prohibited
the deprivation of a free man’s private rights “except by the
lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.” A.
Howard, Magna Carta: Text and Commentary 45 (rev. ed.
1998); see Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644, 723 (2015)
(). By the founding, the Magna

Carta was understood to mean that “no subject would be
deprived of a private right—that is, a right of life, liberty,
or property—except in accordance with ‘the law of the land,’
which consisted only of statutory and common law.” Asso-
ciation of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 72 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (citing N. Chapman & M. McConnell, Due Pro-
cess as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1688
(2012)).
A rule made by someone other than the legislature, such
as the King, was not “‘the law of the land.’” Association of
American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 72 (opinion of THOMAS,
J.). Chief Justice Coke famously held invalid the King’s
proclamation prohibiting new buildings in London because
the King could not “create any offence” “without Parlia-
ment.” Case of Proclamations, 12 Co. Rep. 74, 74–75, 77
Eng. Rep. 1352, 1353 (K. B. 1611); see Association of Amer-
ican Railroads, 575 U. S., at 72 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (ex-
plaining that this principle was associated with chapter 39
of the Magna Carta). When the Founders transplanted the
same principle into the Due Process Clause, they ensured
that when the government wanted to deprive people of the
familiar core private rights of “life, liberty, and property,” it
could not do so “on the basis of a rule (or a will) not enacted
by the legislature.” Id., at 75–76.
B
Neither the Legislative Vesting Clause nor the Due Pro-
cess Clause forbids Congress from delegating its other pow-
ers. As this Court put it two centuries ago, although Con-
gress cannot delegate powers that are “strictly and
exclusively legislative,” it can “certainly delegate” others.
Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42–43 (1825) (opinion
for the Court by Marshall, C. J.).
Many of Congress’s powers fall within the core legislative
power subject to the nondelegation doctrine. For example,
the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate

commerce among the States. Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Congress can
thus make substantive rules for interstate trade—such as
by restricting drug shipments across state lines—punisha-
ble with fines or imprisonment. Cf. Gonzales v. Raich, 545
U. S. 1, 58 (2005) (). Likewise, the
Constitution gives Congress many other powers that impli-
cate life, liberty, and property, including the power to pro-
vide for the punishment of counterfeiting, Art. I, §8, cl. 6;
the power to provide for the punishment of treason, Art. III,
§3, cl. 2; and the power to impose internal taxes, Art. I, §8,
cl. 1; Amdt. 16. These powers cannot be delegated, as I have
repeatedly explained. See, e.g., Association of American
Railroads, 575 U. S., at 77 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); Whit-
man v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 487
(2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring). They cannot be delegated
even if Congress delegates them unambiguously. Cf. ante,
at 8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).
Congress also has many powers that are not subject to
the nondelegation doctrine. “We now think of the powers
listed in Article I, Section 8 as quintessentially legislative
powers, but many of them were actual, former, or asserted
powers of the Crown, which the drafters decided to allocate
to the legislative branch.” M. McConnell, The President
Who Would Not Be King 274 (2020) (McConnell); accord,
Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U. S. 1, 36 (2015) (THOMAS, J., con-
curring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). These
include the powers to raise and support armies, to fix the
standards of weights and measures, to grant copyrights, to
dispose of federal property, and, as discussed below, to reg-
ulate foreign commerce. Art. I, §8; Art. IV, §3. None of
these powers involves setting the rules for the deprivation
of core private rights. Blackstone called them “prerogative”
powers, and sometimes “executive.” See 1 Blackstone 242,
245, 255–262, 264–265, 276, 279; 2 id., at 407, 410 (1766);
1 W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History
of the United States 416, 421–425 (1953); McConnell 274–

275. By one count, 13 of the 29 powers given to Congress in
Article I were powers that “Blackstone described as ‘execu-
tive’ powers.” 1 Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution, at
428.
For most of American history, the nondelegation doctrine
was understood not to apply to these powers. Contra, ante,
at 42–46 (). “The early congresses
felt free to delegate certain powers to President Washington
in broad terms.” McConnell 333. Thus, the Constitution
gives Congress the power to support armies, Art. I, §8, cl.
12, but Congress in 1789 delegated to the President the
power to establish regulations for benefits to veterans
wounded in the Revolutionary War. See Act of Sept. 29,
1789, ch. 24, 1 Stat. 95. The Constitution gives Congress
the power to grant patents, Art. I, §8, cl. 8, but Congress in
1790 delegated to executive officials the power to grant pa-
tents in their discretion. See Act of Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1,
1 Stat. 109–110. The Constitution gives Congress the
power to borrow money, Art. I, §8, cl. 2, but Congress in
1790 delegated to the President the power to borrow up to
$12 million on behalf of the United States in his discretion.
See Act of Aug. 4, 1790, §2, 1 Stat. 139. The Constitution
gives Congress the power to raise armies, Art. I, §8, cl. 12,
but Congress in 1791 delegated to the President the power
to raise an army of 2,000 troops in his discretion. See Act
of Mar. 3, 1791, §8, 1 Stat. 223. And, as I explain further
below, see infra, at 13–15, the Constitution gives Congress
the power to regulate foreign commerce, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, but
early Congresses often delegated to the President the power
to regulate foreign commerce. See, e.g., Act of July 22, 1790,
ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137; Act of June 4, 1794, ch. 41, 1 Stat. 372.
These early delegations had one thing in common: They
did not implicate the Legislative Vesting Clause or the Due
Process Clause. “None of these statutes disturbed natural
rights or intruded into the core of the legislative power.”
McConnell 333; cf. A. Bamzai, Comment, Delegation and

Interpretive Discretion: Gundy, Kisor, and the Formation
and Future of Administrative Law, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 164,
178 (2019). They therefore did not violate the nondelega-
tion doctrine.
The Constitutional Convention seemed to agree with this
understanding of delegation. Contra, ante, at 42
(). James Madison proposed an
amendment clarifying that the President had the power “‘to
execute such other powers’” as were “‘delegated by the na-
tional Legislature,’” so long as the delegated powers were
“‘“not Legislative nor Judiciary in their nature.”’” 1 Rec-
ords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 67 (M. Farrand
ed. 1966). Thus, in Madison’s view, some of Congress’s pow-
ers were “not Legislative” and could be “delegated” to the
President. Ibid. Madison’s proposal was rejected after oth-
ers argued that it was unnecessary. Ibid. Madison agreed
that the purpose of the proposed amendment was only to
“prevent doubts and misconstructions.” Ibid. Nobody dis-
puted that Madison stated the correct scope of the nondele-
gation doctrine. Ibid.; see also McConnell 332 (“[W]e can
infer [from Madison’s motion] that the framers understood
that Congress would be able to delegate its royal preroga-
tive powers back to the President”).2
——————
2Thus, although many used the word “legislative” in the broader sense
to describe powers that should initially belong to the legislature, ante, at
42–43 (), the Founders likely understood the
Legislative Vesting Clause to refer more narrowly to “core legislative
power,” Department of Transportation v. Association of American Rail-
roads, 575 U. S. 43, 80 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). That
understanding accorded with the views of separation-of-powers theorists
of the time, who distinguished the three core functions of government
from the institutions that would exercise them in any given polity. S.
Prakash & M. Ramsey, Foreign Affairs and the Jeffersonian Executive,
89 Minn. L. Rev 1591, 1612–1617 (2005); see 1 B. de Montesquieu, The
Spirit of Laws 151–153 (T. Nugent transl., rev. ed. 1899). For nondele-
gation purposes, therefore, “[t]he key is to distinguish between strictly
legislative authority—the power to make rules binding on persons or

II
As a matter of original understanding, historical practice,
and judicial precedent, the power to impose duties on im-
ports is not within the core legislative power. Congress can
therefore delegate the exercise of this power to the Presi-
dent.
A
Neither of the two constitutional foundations for the non-
delegation doctrine forbids Congress from delegating to the
President the power to impose duties on imports.
1
The Legislative Vesting Clause provides no basis for ap-
plying the nondelegation doctrine to the power to impose
duties on imports.
“The ‘power over external affairs [is] in origin and essen-
tial character different from that over internal affairs.’”
Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. 255, 356 (2023) (THOMAS,
J., dissenting) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-
port Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319 (1936)). Although internal
affairs are governed by the domestic law of one sovereign,
external affairs implicate the relationship between sover-
eigns, which is subject to the law of nations. See Locke
§§145–148, at 383–384; 1 Blackstone 264; 4 id., at 66–68
(1769); E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations 161–163, 281–289
(J. Chitty ed. 1852) (Vattel). External affairs, then, are not
susceptible to being “directed by antecedent, standing, pos-
itive Laws” made by one nation. Locke §147, at 384. When
a person goes abroad, he must resort to the political
branches (and ultimately the military)—rather than the ju-
diciary—for protection, can indebt the executive to foreign
nations for his personal misconduct, and can trigger a for-
eign conflict. See Vattel 161–163, 281–289; 2 F. Wharton,

property within the nation—and other powers assigned to Congress.”
McConnell 327.

Digest of International Law §222, pp. 575–576 (2d ed.
1887); see also id., §§189, 213–221, at 432–445, 539–575.
The power to regulate external affairs was accordingly
not viewed as within the core legislative power at the found-
ing. See Zivotofsky, 576 U. S., at 35–37 (opinion of THOMAS,
J.). Blackstone described powers over “intercourse with for-
eign nations” as “prerogative” powers naturally belonging
to the King. 1 Blackstone 245; see id., at 232. Locke agreed
that this power “must be lodged” with the “executive.” Zi-
votofsky, 576 U. S., at 35 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing
Locke §148). Baron de Montesquieu classified all powers
“in respect to things dependent on the law of nations” as
part of “the executive power.” 1 The Spirit of Laws 151 (T.
Nugent transl., rev. ed. 1899). The “legislative” power, by
contrast, “applied only within the realm.” McConnell 214.
The power to regulate external affairs included power
over foreign commerce. At the founding, the “external ex-
ecutive power” included “‘the transactions of the state with
any other independent state.’” Zivotofsky, 576 U. S., at 36
(opinion of THOMAS, J.). In Great Britain, the King had no
unilateral legislative power, McConnell 107, but he had
much unilateral power over foreign commerce. His power
over foreign commerce included the power to “govern for-
eign trade,” id., at 216, and to “prohibit any of his subjects
from leaving the realm,” 1 Blackstone 261; accord, East In-
dia Co. v. Sandys, Skin. 223, 223–224, 90 Eng. Rep. 103
(K. B. 1684) (describing the “inherent prerogative in the
Crown, that none should trade with foreigners without the
King’s licence”). Thomas Rutherforth’s Institutes of Natu-
ral Law—“a treatise routinely cited by the Founders,” Zivo-
tofsky, 576 U. S., at 36 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)—explained
that the “external executive power” included “the power of
adjusting the rights of a nation in respect of . . . trade.” 2
Institutes of Natural Law 55–56 (1756); accord, Locke §146,
at 383. The power to impose duties on imports was a con-
ventional method for governing foreign trade. It originated

as a “prerogative right” of the King, N. Gras, Early English
Customs System 21 (1918).3
2
The Due Process Clause likewise provides no basis for ap-
plying the nondelegation doctrine to the power to impose
duties on imports. The Due Process Clause protects
“rights,” not “privileges.” Gutierrez v. Saenz, 606 U. S. 305,
331 (2025) (). Importing is a matter
of privilege.
The government can charge money for privileges without
depriving a person of property for due-process purposes.
The government charges people money every day for a wide
range of activities, such as to enter a government park, mail
an envelope, apply for a copyright, or file a lawsuit. Be-
cause a person has no core private right to engage in these
activities, the government is not subject to due-process re-
straints in setting such charges. The due-process question
is not whether a government action “‘raise[s] revenue,’”
ante, at 6 (majority opinion), but whether it implicates core
private rights. Supra, at 3–4. Thus, when Congress dele-
gates power to make “regulations” on federal land, the Sec-
retary of Agriculture can set a “charge” for the “privilege of
grazing sheep” on that land without thereby “exercis[ing]
the legislative power.” United States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S.
506, 522–523 (1911); see also Bamzai, 133 Harv. L. Rev., at
180–182; contra, ante, at 8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Con-
gress has, consistent with due process, delegated the power
to set charges for a wide range of privileges. See 16 U. S. C.
§6802 (delegating the power to set fees for entrance to and

3See also P. Einzig, The Control of the Purse: Progress and Decline of
Parliament’s Financial Control 65 (1959) (“[T]he origin of the term ‘cus-
toms’ is that it had been the ancient customary practice of the Crown to
levy charges on imports and exports on its own authority”). Parliament
took some of that prerogative power away, but delegated it back in broad
terms to the King, see id., at 65–70, who was still agreed to have no leg-
islative power, McConnell 107–110.

ing the power to “by regulation set reasonable fees” for ap-
plications); 39 U. S. C. §3622 (delegating the power to set
postal rates); 28 U. S. C. §1911 (“The Supreme Court may
fix the fees to be charged by its clerk”).
A person had no core private right to import goods at the
founding. On the Founders’ understanding, statutes allow-
ing “importation of goods from abroad were thought to cre-
ate mere privileges rather than core private rights.” Nel-
son, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at 580. Foreign commerce was
governed by the law of nations, which is a law of “sover-
eigns,” not of “private individuals.” Vattel 285. “[A]ny at-
tempt to introduce foreign goods” without the “expressed al-
lowances” of the sovereign was “a violation of its
sovereignty.” Cross v. Harrison, 16 How. 164, 196 (1854).
“Every state” had “a right to prohibit the entrance of foreign
merchandises,” including through the imposition of duties
on imports. Vattel §§90, 99, at 38, 43. Because “no one had
a vested right to import” any “goods from abroad,” the im-
position of “tariffs” as a condition for importing those goods
did not implicate the Due Process Clause any more than
when the government charges money for other privileges.
Nelson, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at 580.
* * *
The power to impose duties on imports thus does not im-
plicate either of the constitutional foundations for the non-
delegation doctrine. Hence, even the strongest critics of del-
egation, myself included, have recognized that regulations
of foreign commerce might not be subject to ordinary non-
delegation limitations. See FCC v. Consumers’ Research,
606 U. S. 656, 742, n. 19 (2025) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting)
(“[I]t may be . . . that tariffs and domestic taxes present dif-
ferent contexts when it comes to the problem of delega-
tion”); accord, Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S.,
at 80, and n. 5 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). So long as Congress

complies with other constitutional limitations, it can dele-
gate this power.
B
Historical practice and precedent confirm that Congress
can delegate the power to impose duties on imports.
1
Since the 1790s, Congress has consistently delegated to
the President power over foreign commerce, including the
power to impose duties on imports. “‘Practically every vol-
ume of the United States Statutes’” contains broad delega-
tions to the President in the area of foreign commerce. Id.,
at 80, n. 5 (quoting Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.,
at 324).
The First Congress gave the President the power to “pre-
scribe” “rules and regulations” that would “gover[n]” any
person licensed to trade with Indians. 1 Stat. 137. Trade
with Indians was regarded as “a matter of external rela-
tions.” McConnell 333. In delegating this power, Congress
did not specify or limit what kinds of regulations the Presi-
dent could impose. Act of July 22, 1790, 1 Stat. 137–138.
Pursuant to that broad delegation, the President restricted
trading “[d]istilled [s]pirits,” required each trader to “give
intelligence” to the Government, and subdelegated to his
superintendents the power to “assign the limits within
which each trader shall trade.” 61 Timothy Pickering Pa-
pers, Massachusetts Historical Society 4 (Aug. 28, 1790);
see also Letter from G. Washington to H. Knox (Aug. 13,
1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington 244–245 (D.
Twohig ed. 1996). Any person who violated the President’s
regulations would owe $1,000 “payable to the President.” 1
Stat. 137.
Succeeding early Congresses delegated many more pow-
ers over foreign commerce to the President. In 1794, Con-
gress delegated to the President the power to “lay an

embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports of the United
States,” including ships belonging to Americans, unless
Congress was in session. Act of June 4, 1794, 1 Stat. 372.
It authorized the President to make “such regulations as
the circumstances of the case may require” in exercising
that delegated power. Ibid. Congress allowed the Presi-
dent to impose the embargo as “in his opinion, the public
safety shall so require.” Ibid. In 1795, Congress delegated
to the President the power to “permit the exportation of
arms, cannon and military stores, the law prohibiting the
exportation of the same to the contrary notwithstanding.”
Act of Mar. 3, 1795, ch. 53, 1 Stat. 444. In 1798, Congress
delegated to the President the power to discontinue “prohi-
bitions and restraints” on commerce with France. Act of
June 13, 1798, 1 Stat. 565–566; see also, e.g., Act of Mar. 3,
1817, ch. 39, 3 Stat. 361–362 (delegating to the President
the power to discontinue a ban on importation of plaster of
Paris). In 1799, Congress delegated to the President the
authority to discontinue and to reimpose “restraints and
prohibitions” on commerce with France when he “deem[ed]
it expedient and consistent with the interest of the United
States.” Act of Feb. 9, 1799, 1 Stat. 615. And, in 1800, Con-
gress delegated to the President the power to remove a ban
on trade with France, and to “re-establish” certain “re-
straints and prohibitions” when he “deem[ed] it expedient.”
Act of Feb. 27, 1800, 2 Stat. 9–10.4
Congress likewise delegated to the President the power
to set duties on imports. In 1815, Congress delegated to the
President the power to lower reciprocal duties when he was
“satisfied” that other nations’ trade practices no longer op-
erated “to the disadvantage of the United States.” Act of
Mar. 3, 1815, ch. 77, 3 Stat. 224. In 1824, Congress

bates,” ante, at 43 (concurring opinion), is thus difficult to reconcile with
what early Congresses actually did.

delegated to the President the power to lower and to reim-
pose duties in response to foreign nations’ trade practices.
See Act of Jan. 7, 1824, 4 Stat. 2–3. Throughout the early
decades of the Republic, Congress continued to delegate to
the President similar powers over duties on imports on a
regular basis. See, e.g., Act of May 24, 1828, ch. 111, 4 Stat.
308; Act of May 31, 1830, ch. 219, 4 Stat. 425; Act of July
13, 1832, ch. 207, 4 Stat. 578–579. Presidents frequently
changed the rates of duties on imports as to various foreign
nations pursuant to these delegations.5

This Court has consistently upheld Congress’s delegation
of power over foreign commerce, including the power to im-
pose duties on imports.
The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may “in-
vest the President with large discretion in matters arising
out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and com-
merce with other nations.” Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark,
143 U. S. 649, 691 (1892). Since shortly after the founding,
the Court has rejected challenges to delegations of power
over foreign commerce. See Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United

United States” as to the Free Hanseatic city of Bremen); see also, e.g.,

States, 7 Cranch 382, 386, 387–389 (1813). Even when a
“challenged delegation, if it were confined to internal af-
fairs, would be invalid,” the Court has upheld the delega-
tion. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at 315, 322.
There is a “fundamental” difference, the Court has ex-
plained, between “foreign or external affairs” and “domestic
or internal affairs.” Id., at 315. Thus, “Congress may of
course delegate very large grants of its power over foreign
commerce to the President,” Chicago & Southern Air Lines,
Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 109 (1948), in-
cluding when it comes to imposing “duties” on imports,
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at 325, n. 2.
When Congress has delegated to the President the power
to impose duties on imports, this Court has upheld those
delegations. In Clark, 143 U. S. 649, the Court upheld Con-
gress’s delegation to the President of the power to impose
duties on nations whose importation policies “he may deem
to be reciprocally unequal and unreasonable.” Id., at 680.
It explained that Congress had “frequently, from the organ-
ization of the government to the present time,” conferred
powers over “trade and commerce” to “the President.” Id.,
at 683. In J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276
U. S. 394 (1928), the Court upheld a delegation to the Pres-
ident to impose duties as necessary up to statutorily limited
rates to make them reciprocal. Id., at 401, 409. And, in
Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426
U. S. 548 (1976), the Court upheld a delegation of the power
to impose a universal duty on imported oil. Id., at 555, 558–
560.6

6The Court has even suggested that the President has inherent peace-
time authority to impose duties on imports. After the Mexican-American
War ended, executive officials imposed duties on imports at a California
port within the United States before Congress had “passed an act to ex-
tend the collection of tonnage and import duties to the ports of Califor-
nia.” Cross v. Harrison, 16 How. 164, 190 (1854); see also id., at 192,
194–196. The executive officials unilaterally extended Congress’s earlier

Although these cases involved duties on imports, the
Court nowhere suggested that a different nondelegation
rule applied because the duty was a “tax” or “raise[d] reve-
nue.” Ante, at 6 (majority opinion) (internal quotation
marks omitted).7

Congress’s delegation here was constitutional. The stat-
ute at issue in these cases, the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, delegates to the President a wide
range of powers over foreign commerce. IEEPA gives the
President, on conditions satisfied here, the power to “regu-
late” foreign commerce, including “importation” of foreign
property. 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B).
IEEPA’s delegation of power to impose duties on imports
complies with the nondelegation doctrine. Congress dele-
gated to the President a version of the same power that it
has delegated to him in many statutes since the early days
of the Republic. See supra, at 13–17. Congress limited that
delegation to foreign commerce. See §1702(a)(1)(B); see
also §1701. In delegating the power to impose duties on
imports, it gave the President no core legislative power to
make substantive rules setting the conditions for depriva-
tions of life, liberty, or property. Its delegation therefore
complied with the constitutional separation of powers and
is consistent with centuries of practice and precedent. It
did not need to exercise that power itself and did not need
to delegate it “unambiguously”—even though, as JUSTICE

authorized duties to new ports. Id., at 193. Although the Court’s rea-
soning was somewhat opaque, the Court upheld the executive officials’
unilateral peacetime duties in part because nobody has a right to “intro-
duce foreign goods” except with the sovereign’s “expressed allowances.”
Id., at 196–197.
7In fact, less than a year ago, the Court explicitly rejected “a special
nondelegation rule for revenue-raising legislation.” FCC v. Consumers’
Research, 606 U. S. 656, 674 (2025).

KAVANAUGH explains, it did. See post, at 38–45 (dissenting
opinion).
The principal opinion bases its decision on the major
questions doctrine. Ante, at 7–13 (opinion of ROBERTS,
C. J.). In some cases, the Court has used the major ques-
tions doctrine as a canon of statutory interpretation be-
cause delegations of major powers are unlikely to be subtle.
See, e.g., Whitman, 531 U. S., at 468; see ante, at 8 (opinion
of ROBERTS, C. J.); see also Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S.
477, 501–503 (2023). In other cases, the Court has used it
to avoid what would have been originally understood as an
unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. See, e.g.,
West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (2022); ante, at 8
(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). In today’s cases, neither the
statutory text nor the Constitution provide a basis for rul-
ing against the President. I respectfully dissent.
