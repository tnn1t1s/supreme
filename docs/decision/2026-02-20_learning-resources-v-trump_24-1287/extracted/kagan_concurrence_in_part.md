ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and
JUSTICE JACKSON join, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
The Court holds today that the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the Pres-
ident to impose tariffs. I agree with that conclusion, as I do
with the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning. But be-
cause I think the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation
amply support today’s result, I do not join the part of that
opinion invoking the so-called major-questions doctrine.
The question that part asks, similar to the one posed in
other “‘major questions’ cases,” is whether the President
can identify “clear congressional authorization” for his ac-
tion—here, to impose tariffs under IEEPA. Ante, at 7, 13,
20. The demand is for a clear statement—something more

explicit or specific than the statutory basis that would ordi-
narily suffice to support executive action. See, e.g., West
Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 721–724, 732 (2022); Biden
v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 505–506 (2023). The reason for
that requirement, according to today’s opinion, is that the
Executive has claimed an “extraordinary” power—one
never asserted before and having large-scale “economic and
political significance.” Ante, at 7, 11; see ante, at 7–11.
I objected, in the principal cases cited, to the demand for
a special brand of legislative clarity. See West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 764–784 (KAGAN, J., dissenting); Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 542–550 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). In my view, the
Court used its clear-authorization rule in those cases to ne-
gate expansive delegations Congress had approved. I ex-
plained there that the proper way to interpret a delegation
provision is through the standard rules of statutory con-
struction. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 765–766 (KAGAN,
J., dissenting). That means, most concisely stated, reading
text in context. More expansively put, it means examining
a delegation provision’s language, assessing that provi-
sion’s place in the broader statutory scheme, and applying
a “modicum of common sense” about how Congress typically
delegates. Id., at 764 (KAGAN, J., dissenting); see FDA v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133
(2000). The last of those inquiries includes consideration of
whether Congress ever has before, or likely would, delegate
the power the Executive asserts—a matter also of import in
applying the major-questions doctrine. See ante, at 8–10;
Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512–514, 517–519 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring); id., at 546, n. 3 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). In the
past, though, I have thought that the Court used that doc-
trine to override—rather than help discover—the best read-
ing of delegation statutes. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
756 (KAGAN, J., dissenting); Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 543
(KAGAN, J., dissenting).

This case presents more nearly the opposite situation:
The use of a clear-statement rule here is unnecessary be-
cause ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to
the same result.1 It is not just that the Government’s argu-
ments fail to satisfy an especially strict test; it is that they
fail to satisfy the normal one. Even without a clear-state-
ment rule in the picture, the conclusion follows: IEEPA does
not authorize the President to impose tariffs. And indeed,
the principal opinion’s reasoning well explains why. The
rest of this opinion draws on that analysis (I hope without
too much rehashing) to demonstrate what I view as the fun-
damental point: Usual text-in-context interpretation dooms
the tariffs the President has imposed. The crucial provision
of IEEPA, when viewed in light of the broader statutory
scheme and with a practical awareness of how Congress
delegates tariff authority, does not give the President the
power he wants.
Most important, IEEPA’s key phrase—the one the Gov-
ernment relies on—says nothing about imposing tariffs or
——————
1 JUSTICE GORSUCH claims not to understand this statement, insisting
that I now must be applying the major-questions doctrine, and his own
version of it to boot. See ante, at 17 (concurring opinion) (“My concurring
colleagues all but endorse it today”); ante, at 2, 7, 18 (similar). Given
how strong his apparent desire for converts, see ante, at 2–26, I almost
regret to inform him that I am not one. But that is the fact of the matter.
I proceed in this case just as I did in West Virginia and Nebraska: I con-
sider a delegation provision’s language, broaden the scope to take in the
statutory setting, and apply some common sense about how Congress
normally delegates. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 756–766
(2022) (KAGAN, J., dissenting); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 534–
542 (2023) (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Contrary to JUSTICE GORSUCH’s sug-
gestion, see ante, at 3–7, that conventional method of interpretation will
not always favor (or always disfavor) executive officials, given the variety
of delegation schemes Congress adopts. I’ll let JUSTICE GORSUCH reliti-
gate on his own our old debates about other statutes, unrelated to the
one before us. What matters here is only that IEEPA’s delegation refutes
the Executive’s assertion of authority to levy tariffs, without any help
from the major-questions doctrine.

taxes. That text authorizes the President, upon finding a
foreign threat and declaring an emergency, to “regulate”
the “importation” of foreign goods. 50 U. S. C.
§1702(a)(1)(B). And the meaning of “regulate,” both in com-
mon parlance and as Congress uses the word, does not en-
compass taxing. See ante, at 14–15. To “regulate,” accord-
ing to the Government’s preferred definition, means to “fix,
establish or control; to adjust by rule, method, or estab-
lished mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to
governing principles or laws.” Brief for Federal Parties 24
(quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1156 (5th ed. 1979)). Noth-
ing in that definition naturally refers to levying taxes. Nor
does Congress ever use the word “regulate” in that way.
Hundreds of provisions in the U. S. Code give agencies the
authority to “regulate” one thing or another. Yet the Gov-
ernment cannot identify a single one that is understood to
grant taxing power. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. When Con-
gress wants to delegate that power, it uses a whole different
vocabulary—terms like “duty,” “tariff,” or “surcharge,”
which do not appear in IEEPA. See ante, at 8 (citing repre-
sentative statutes); see also ante, at 19 (discussing, in par-
ticular, 19 U. S. C. §1862 (1970 ed.)). And likewise, when
Congress means to cover both regulatory and taxing pow-
ers, it refers to each separately. See ante, at 15 (also citing
statutes). Of course, Congress knows that taxes can be used
for regulatory ends: They can be a means of controlling or
adjusting behavior. But Congress still follows the path this
Court long ago marked out, and the one most consonant
with ordinary meaning, of treating the power to “regulate”
trade as “entirely distinct” from the power to “levy taxes.”
Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 201–202 (1824); see ante, at
15. So in granting only the former, IEEPA excludes the lat-
ter: The President has the ability to regulate, but not to im-
pose taxes on, imports.
The surrounding statutory language confirms the point.
As the principal opinion explains, “regulate” is one of 9

verbs listed in IEEPA’s delegation provision. See ante, at
15. (The others are “investigate,” “block,” “direct,” “compel,”
“nullify,” “void,” “prevent,” and “prohibit.” §1702(a)(1)(B).)
Those verbs are followed by 11 objects, each describing a
distinct sort of transaction involving foreign property—not
just “importation,” but also “acquisition,” “use,” “transfer,”
and so forth. Ibid. Combine the verbs and objects in all
possible ways, and the statute authorizes 99 actions a Pres-
ident can take to address a foreign threat. And exactly none
of the other 98 involves raising revenues. Rather, each en-
ables the President to impose penalties, restrictions, or con-
trols on foreign commerce. See ante, at 15. So when the
phrase “regulate . . . importation” is invoked to impose
quantity or quality limits on bringing foreign goods into the
country—for example, by setting quotas or requiring quar-
antines—the phrase fits well with its 98 neighbors. Just
like the rest, it provides a way to constrain or alter various
foreign transactions. But when that phrase is invoked to
impose tariffs? Then it becomes the odd man out—the only
one of 99 permission slips to involve “the core congressional
power of the purse.” Ante, at 8; see ante, at 5–6. So even if
(contra both conventional and congressional usage) the
word “regulate” might refer to taxation in some other (hith-
erto undiscovered) statutory context, it would not do so in
IEEPA.2
Likewise, Congress’s consistent practice in delegating
tariff power refutes the Government’s position. As the
——————
2The legislative history of IEEPA offers yet more proof that Congress
did not authorize taxation. The Senate Report, in its description of the
statute, reduces the 99 authorized actions to the following: the power “to
control or freeze property transactions where a foreign interest is in-
volved.” S. Rep. No. 95–466, p. 5 (1977). The House Report similarly
describes the delegation provision as “authoriz[ing] the President” to
“regulate or freeze any property in which any foreign country or a na-
tional thereof has any interest.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–459, p. 15 (1977).
Neither of those descriptions at all suggests that Congress intended to
cede its taxing power.

principal opinion details, Title 19 of the U. S. Code includes
multiple provisions granting the President authority to levy
tariffs. See ante, at 8–9. But in each and every instance,
Congress has not only used specific language (e.g., “duty” or
“surcharge”), see supra, at 4, but also imposed tight re-
straints on the power given. It has capped the tariff ’s rate
(e.g., 15%); or limited the tariff ’s duration (e.g., 150 days);
or established strict procedural conditions before the tariff
can take effect (e.g., investigations, public hearings, and re-
ports); or all of the above. See ante, at 8–9. What Congress
has never done in a tariff provision is what the Government
claims it did here—conferred power on the President to im-
pose a tariff of any amount, for any time, on only his own
say-so. And construing IEEPA to give that unparalleled au-
thority would effectively erase all the carefully confined tar-
iff provisions in Title 19. For any President could then es-
cape the rigors of those laws—could put in place, say, a non-
time-limited 100% tariff on all foreign products—by the
simple expedient of identifying a foreign threat. That gut-
ting of Title 19’s tariff scheme is not what Congress, when
delegating power to “regulate” imports, could have meant
to accomplish.
Nor has any President until now understood IEEPA to
authorize imposing tariffs. Between 1977 (when IEEPA
was enacted) and 2024, eight Presidents had the chance to
make use of IEEPA’s delegation of power. And all chose the
same course. They invoked the statute’s “regulate importa-
tion” provision for a variety of non-tariff purposes. See ante,
at 10. But they looked elsewhere—to Title 19’s provisions—
for tariff authority. See ante, at 10–11. In other words,
each President read the statutes as Congress wrote them,
with IEEPA enabling him to regulate imports and Title 19
enabling him—in confined situations—to tax those foreign

goods. None, as far as anyone has suggested, even consid-
ered doing otherwise.3
For all those reasons, straight-up statutory construction
resolves this case for me; I need no major-questions thumb
on the interpretive scales. IEEPA gives the President sig-
nificant authority over transactions involving foreign prop-
erty, including the importation of goods. But in that gener-
ous delegation, one power is conspicuously missing.
Nothing in IEEPA’s text, nor anything in its context, ena-
bles the President to unilaterally impose tariffs. And need-
less to say, without statutory authority, the President’s tar-
iffs cannot stand. See ante, at 5–6.
——————
3Presidents followed the same practice, with one quasi-exception, un-
der IEEPA’s predecessor statute, the Trading with the Enemy Act
(TWEA). Beginning in 1941, TWEA authorized the President, as IEEPA
does now, to “regulate . . . importation.” 12 U. S. C. §95a(1)(B) (1940 ed.,
Supp. I). During the next three decades, six Presidents used that dele-
gation for only non-tariff ends, while relying on Title 19 to levy tariffs.
In 1971, when President Nixon imposed tariffs in response to a balance-
of-payments deficit, he continued in that tradition by invoking two stat-
utes (the Tariff Act of 1930 and Trade Expansion Act of 1962) found in
Title 19. See Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 3 CFR 60 (1971–1975
Comp.). But in defending his act against a legal challenge, the Depart-
ment of Justice argued that even if the two cited statutes did not author-
ize the tariffs, TWEA would do so. That after-the-fact claim of authority
was upheld in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. See United
States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 572, 577–578 (CCPA 1975);
ante, at 17. The principal opinion well explains why that single lower
court decision about TWEA has no bearing on IEEPA’s meaning. See
ante, at 17–18, and n. 5.
