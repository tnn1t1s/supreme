SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

LEARNING RESOURCES, INC., ET AL. v. TRUMP,
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL.
CERTIORARI BEFORE JUDGMENT TO THE UNITED STATES
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
No. 24–1287. Argued November 5, 2025—Decided February 20, 2026*
The question presented is whether the International Emergency Eco-
nomic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorizes the President to impose tariffs.
See 91 Stat. 1626. Shortly after taking office, President Trump sought
to address two foreign threats: the influx of illegal drugs from Canada,
Mexico, and China, Presidential Proclamation No. 10886, 90 Fed. Reg.
8327; Exec. Order No. 14193, 90 Fed. Reg. 9113; Exec. Order No.
14194, 90 Fed. Reg. 9117; Exec. Order No. 14195, 90 Fed. Reg. 9121,
and “large and persistent” trade deficits, Exec. Order No. 14257, 90
Fed. Reg. 15041. The President determined that the drug influx had
“created a public health crisis,” 90 Fed. Reg. 9113, and that the trade
deficits had “led to the hollowing out” of the American manufacturing
base and “undermined critical supply chains,” id., at 15041. The Pres-
ident declared a national emergency as to both threats, deeming them
“unusual and extraordinary,” and invoked his authority under IEEPA
to respond.
He imposed tariffs to deal with each threat. As to the drug traffick-
ing tariffs, the President imposed a 25% duty on most Canadian and
Mexican imports and a 10% duty on most Chinese imports. Id., at
9114, 9118, 9122–9123. As to the trade deficit (“reciprocal”) tariffs, the
President imposed a duty “on all imports from all trading partners” of

Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

at least 10%, with dozens of nations facing higher rates. Id., at 15045,
15049. Since imposing each set of tariffs, the President has issued sev-
eral increases, reductions, and other modifications.
Petitioners in Learning Resources and respondents in V.O.S. Selec-
tions filed suit, alleging that IEEPA does not authorize the reciprocal
or drug trafficking tariffs. The Learning Resources plaintiffs—two
small businesses—sued in the United States District Court for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. That court denied the Government’s motion to
transfer the case to the United States Court of International Trade
(CIT) and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction,
concluding that IEEPA did not grant the President the power to im-
pose tariffs. The V.O.S. Selections plaintiffs—five small businesses
and 12 States—sued in the CIT. That court granted summary judg-
ment for the plaintiffs. And the Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, af-
firmed in relevant part, concluding that IEEPA’s grant of authority to
“regulate . . . importation” did not authorize the challenged tariffs,
which “are unbounded in scope, amount, and duration.” 149 F. 4th
1312, 1338. The Government filed a petition for certiorari in V.O.S.
Selections, and the Learning Resources plaintiffs filed a petition for
certiorari before judgment. The Court granted the petitions and con-
solidated the cases.
Held: IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The
judgment in No. 24–1287 is vacated, and the case is remanded with
instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; the judgment in No. 25–
250 is affirmed.
No. 24–1287, 784 F. Supp. 3d 209, vacated and remanded; No. 25–250,
149 F. 4th 1312, affirmed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I and II–A–1:
Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution specifies that “The Congress
shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Ex-
cises.” The Framers recognized the unique importance of this taxing
power—a power which “very clear[ly]” includes the power to impose
tariffs. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 201. And they gave Congress
“alone . . . access to the pockets of the people.” The Federalist No. 48,
p. 310 (J. Madison). The Framers did not vest any part of the taxing
power in the Executive Branch. See Nicol v. Ames, 173 U. S. 509, 515.
The Government thus concedes that the President enjoys no inher-
ent authority to impose tariffs during peacetime. It instead relies ex-
clusively on IEEPA to defend the challenged tariffs. It reads the words
“regulate” and “importation” to effect a sweeping delegation of Con-
gress’s power to set tariff policy—authorizing the President to impose
tariffs of unlimited amount and duration, on any product from any

country. 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B). Pp. 5–7.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE GORSUCH and JUSTICE
BARRETT, concluded in Part II–A–2:
The Court has long expressed “reluctan[ce] to read into ambiguous
statutory text” extraordinary delegations of Congress’s powers. West
Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (quoting Utility Air Regulatory
Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 324). In several cases described as in-
volving “major questions,” the Court has reasoned that “both separa-
tion of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative
intent” suggest Congress would not have delegated “highly consequen-
tial power” through ambiguous language. Id., at 723–724. These con-
siderations apply with particular force where, as here, the purported
delegation involves the core congressional power of the purse. Con-
gressional practice confirms as much. When Congress has delegated
its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms and subject to strict
limits.
Against that backdrop of clear and limited delegations, the Govern-
ment reads IEEPA to give the President power to unilaterally impose
unbounded tariffs and change them at will. That view would represent
a transformative expansion of the President’s authority over tariff pol-
icy. It is also telling that in IEEPA’s half century of existence, no Pres-
ident has invoked the statute to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of
this magnitude and scope. That “ ‘lack of historical precedent,’ coupled
with the breadth of authority” that the President now claims, suggests
that the tariffs extend beyond the President’s “legitimate reach.” Na-
tional Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA, 595 U. S. 109, 119
(quoting Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 505). The “ ‘economic and political signifi-
cance’ ” of the authority the President has asserted likewise “provide[s]
a ‘reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress’ meant to confer
such authority.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 721 (quoting FDA v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159–160). The
stakes here dwarf those of other major questions cases. And as in those
cases, “a reasonable interpreter would [not] expect” Congress to
“pawn[]” such a “big-time policy call[] . . . off to another branch.” Biden
v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 515 ().
There is no exception to the major questions doctrine for emergency
statutes. Nor does the fact that tariffs implicate foreign affairs render
the doctrine inapplicable. The Framers gave “Congress alone” the
power to impose tariffs during peacetime. Merritt v. Welsh, 104 U. S.
694, 700. And the foreign affairs implications of tariffs do not make it
any more likely that Congress would relinquish its tariff power
through vague language, or without careful limits. Accordingly, the
President must “point to clear congressional authorization” to justify

his extraordinary assertion of that power. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 506
(internal quotation marks omitted). He cannot. Pp. 7–13.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Part II–B, concluding:
(a) IEEPA authorizes the President to “investigate, block during the
pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void,
prevent or prohibit . . . importation or exportation.” §1702(a)(1)(B).
Absent from this lengthy list of specific powers is any mention of tariffs
or duties. Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraor-
dinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly, as it
consistently has in other tariff statutes.
The power to “regulate . . . importation” does not fill that void. The
term “regulate,” as ordinarily used, means to “fix, establish, or control;
to adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or re-
striction; to subject to governing principles or laws.” Black’s Law Dic-
tionary 1156. The facial breadth of this definition places in stark relief
what ”regulate” is not usually thought to include: taxation. Many stat-
utes grant the Executive the power to “regulate.” Yet the Government
cannot identify any statute in which the power to regulate includes the
power to tax. The Court is therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and
IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax
within the quotidian power to “regulate.”
While taxes may accomplish regulatory ends, it does not follow that
the power to regulate includes the power to tax as a means of regula-
tion. Indeed, when Congress addresses both the power to regulate and
the power to tax, it does so separately and expressly. That it did not
do so here is strong evidence that “regulate” in IEEPA does not include
taxation.
A contrary reading would render IEEPA partly unconstitutional.
IEEPA authorizes the President to “regulate . . . importation or expor-
tation.” §1702(a)(1)(B). But taxing exports is expressly forbidden by
the Constitution. Art. I, §9, cl. 5.
The “neighboring words” with which “regulate” “is associated” also
suggest that Congress did not intend for “regulate” to include the rev-
enue-raising power. United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294.
Each of the nine verbs in §1702(a)(1)(B) authorizes a distinct action a
President might take in sanctioning foreign actors or controlling do-
mestic actors engaged in foreign commerce, as Presidential practice
confirms. And none of the listed authorities includes the distinct and
extraordinary power to raise revenue—a power which no President has
ever found in IEEPA. Pp. 14–16.
(b) Several arguments marshaled in response are unpersuasive.
First, the contention that IEEPA confers the power to impose tariffs
because early commentators and the Court’s cases discuss tariffs in

the context of the Commerce Clause answers the wrong question. The
question is not whether tariffs can ever be a means of regulating com-
merce. It is instead whether Congress, when conferring the power to
“regulate . . . importation,” gave the President the power to impose tar-
iffs at his sole discretion. And Congress’s pattern of usage is plain:
When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly
and with careful constraints. It did neither in IEEPA.
Second, the argument that “regulate” naturally includes tariffs be-
cause the term lies between two poles in IEEPA—“compel” on the af-
firmative end and “prohibit” on the negative end—is unavailing. Alt-
hough tariffs may be less extreme than an outright compulsion or
prohibition, it does not follow that tariffs lie on the spectrum between
those poles; they are different in kind, not degree, from the other au-
thorities in IEEPA. Tariffs operate directly on domestic importers to
raise revenue for the Treasury and are “very clear[ly] . . . a branch of
the taxing power.” Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 201. Thus, they fall outside
the spectrum entirely.
Third, the argument based on IEEPA’s predecessor, the Trading
with the Enemy Act (TWEA), and the Court of Customs and Patent
Appeals’ decision in United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560,
cannot bear the weight placed on it. A single, expressly limited opinion
from a specialized intermediate appellate court does not establish a
well-settled meaning that the Court can assume Congress incorpo-
rated into IEEPA.
Fourth, the historical argument based on the Court’s wartime prec-
edents fails. Those precedents are facially inapposite, as all agree the
President lacks inherent peacetime authority to impose tariffs. And
the attenuated chain of inferences from wartime precedents through
multiple iterations of TWEA to IEEPA cannot support—much less
clearly support—a reading of IEEPA that includes the distinct power
to impose tariffs.
Finally, arguments relying on this Court’s precedents lack merit.
Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548,
bears little on the meaning of IEEPA. Section 232(b) of the Trade Ex-
pansion Act of 1962 contains sweeping, discretion-conferring language
that IEEPA does not contain, and the explicit reference to duties in
Section 232(a) renders it natural for Section 232(b) itself to authorize
duties. Nor does Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, offer support
because that case was exceedingly narrow, did not address the Presi-
dent’s power to “regulate,” and did not involve tariffs at all. Pp. 16–
20.
JUSTICE KAGAN, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and JUSTICE
JACKSON, agreed that IEEPA does not authorize the President to im-
pose tariffs, but concluded that the Court need not invoke the major

questions doctrine because the ordinary tools of statutory interpreta-
tion amply support that result. Pp. 1–7.
JUSTICE JACKSON would also consult legislative history—in particu-
lar, the House and Senate Reports that accompanied IEEPA and its
predecessor statute, TWEA—to determine that Congress did not in-
tend for IEEPA to authorize the Executive to impose tariffs. Pp. 1–5.
ROBERTS, C. J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the
opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II–A–1, and II–B, in which
SOTOMAYOR, KAGAN, GORSUCH, BARRETT, and JACKSON, JJ., joined, and
an opinion with respect to Parts II–A–2 and III, in which GORSUCH and
BARRETT, JJ., joined. GORSUCH, J., and BARRETT, J., filed concurring
opinions. KAGAN, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment, in which SOTOMAYOR and JACKSON, JJ., joined.
JACKSON, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment. THOMAS, J., filed a dissenting opinion. KAVANAUGH, J., filed
a dissenting opinion, in which THOMAS and ALITO, JJ., joined.
