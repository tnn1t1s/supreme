V.O.S. SELECTIONS, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
Acting pursuant to his statutory authority to “regulate
. . . importation” under the 1977 International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, the President has imposed
tariffs on imports of foreign goods from various countries.
The tariffs have generated vigorous policy debates. Those
policy debates are not for the Federal Judiciary to resolve.
Rather, the Judiciary’s more limited role is to neutrally
interpret and apply the law. The sole legal question here is
whether, under IEEPA, tariffs are a means to “regulate . . .
importation.” Statutory text, history, and precedent
demonstrate that the answer is clearly yes: Like quotas
and embargoes, tariffs are a traditional and common tool to
regulate importation.

Since early in U. S. history, Congress has regularly
authorized the President to impose tariffs on imports of
foreign goods. Presidents have often used that authority to
obtain leverage with foreign nations, help American
manufacturers and workers compete on a more level
playing field, and generate revenue for the United States.
Numerous laws such as the Trade Expansion Act of 1962
and the Trade Act of 1974 continue to authorize the
President to place tariffs on foreign imports in a variety of
circumstances, and Presidents have often done so. In
recent years, Presidents George W. Bush, Obama, and
Biden have all imposed tariffs on foreign imports under
those statutory authorities.
President Trump has similarly imposed tariffs, and has
done so here under IEEPA. During declared national
emergencies, IEEPA broadly authorizes the President to
regulate international economic transactions. Most
relevant for this case, during those national emergencies,
IEEPA grants the President the power to “regulate . . .
importation” of foreign goods.
In early 2025, President Trump declared two national
emergencies pursuant to the National Emergencies Act.
See 50 U. S. C. §1621(a). One emergency concerned drug
trafficking into the United States. The other emergency
involved trade imbalances with foreign nations that have
harmed American manufacturers and workers.
To help address those emergencies, the President drew
upon his authority in IEEPA to “regulate . . . importation,”
and he imposed tariffs on imports from various countries.
The plaintiffs argue and the Court concludes that the
President lacks authority under IEEPA to impose tariffs. I
disagree. In accord with Judge Taranto’s careful and
persuasive opinion in the Federal Circuit, I would conclude
that the President’s power under IEEPA to “regulate . . .
importation” encompasses tariffs. As a matter of ordinary
meaning, including dictionary definitions and historical

usage, the broad power to “regulate . . . importation”
includes the traditional and common means to do so—in
particular, quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.
History and precedent confirm that conclusion. In 1971,
President Nixon imposed 10 percent tariffs on almost all
foreign imports. He levied the tariffs under IEEPA’s
predecessor statute, the Trading with the Enemy Act,
which similarly authorized the President to “regulate
. . . importation.” The Nixon tariffs were upheld in court.
Moreover, in 1976, a year before IEEPA was enacted, this
Court unanimously ruled that a similarly worded statute
authorizing the President to “adjust the imports” permitted
President Ford to impose monetary exactions on foreign oil
imports. See Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin
SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548 (1976) (Algonquin).
For both the Nixon tariffs and the Ford tariffs upheld by
this Court in Algonquin, the relevant statutory provisions
did not specifically refer to “tariffs” or “duties,” but instead
more broadly authorized the President to “regulate . . .
importation” or to “adjust the imports.” Therefore, when
IEEPA was enacted in 1977 in the wake of the Nixon and
Ford tariffs and the Algonquin decision, Congress and the
public plainly would have understood that the power to
“regulate . . . importation” included tariffs. If Congress
wanted to exclude tariffs from IEEPA, it surely would not
have enacted the same broad “regulate . . . importation”
language that had just been used to justify major American
tariffs on foreign imports.
Importantly, IEEPA’s authorization for the President to
impose tariffs did not grant the President any new
substantive power. Since the Founding, numerous statutes
have authorized—and still do authorize—the President to
impose tariffs and other foreign import restrictions. IEEPA
merely allows the President to impose tariffs somewhat
more efficiently to deal with foreign threats during national
emergencies.

Context and common sense buttress that interpretation
of IEEPA. The plaintiffs and the Court acknowledge that
IEEPA authorizes the President to impose quotas or
embargoes on foreign imports—meaning that a President
could completely block some or all imports. But they say
that IEEPA does not authorize the President to employ the
lesser power of tariffs, which simply condition imports on a
payment. As they interpret the statute, the President
could, for example, block all imports from China but cannot
order even a $1 tariff on goods imported from China.
That approach does not make much sense. Properly read,
IEEPA does not draw such an odd distinction between
quotas and embargoes on the one hand and tariffs on the
other. Rather, it empowers the President to regulate
imports during national emergencies with the tools
Presidents have traditionally and commonly used,
including quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.
The Court today nonetheless concludes otherwise and
holds that IEEPA does not authorize the President to
impose tariffs to deal with the declared drug trafficking and
trade deficit emergencies. But the Court’s decision is
splintered. In today’s six-Justice majority, three Justices
(JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE
JACKSON) interpret IEEPA not to authorize tariffs as a
matter of ordinary statutory interpretation. I disagree for
the reasons noted above and elaborated on at length in this
opinion.
Three other Justices (THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE
GORSUCH, and JUSTICE BARRETT) lean on the major
questions canon of statutory interpretation to resolve this
case. That important canon requires “clear congressional
authorization” for an executive action of major economic
and political significance, particularly when the Executive
exercises an “unheralded” power. West Virginia v. EPA,
597 U. S. 697, 722–723 (2022) (quotation marks omitted).

In my view, as I will explain, the major questions canon
does not control here for two alternative and independent
reasons.
First, the statutory text, history, and precedent
constitute “clear congressional authorization” for the
President to impose tariffs under IEEPA. In particular,
throughout American history, Presidents have commonly
imposed tariffs as a means to “regulate . . . importation.” So
tariffs were not an “unheralded” power when Congress
enacted IEEPA in 1977 and authorized the President to
“regulate . . . importation” of foreign goods. Therefore, the
major questions doctrine is satisfied here. Cf. Biden v.
Missouri, 595 U. S. 87 (2022) (per curiam).
Second, in any event, the Court has never before applied
the major questions doctrine in the foreign affairs context,
including foreign trade. Rather, as Justice Robert Jackson
summarized and remains true, this Court has always
recognized the “‘unwisdom of requiring Congress in this
field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite
standards by which the President is to be governed.’”
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636,
n. 2 (1952) (concurring opinion) (quoting United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 321–322
(1936)). In foreign affairs cases, courts read the statute as
written and do not employ the major questions doctrine as
a thumb on the scale against the President.
Although I firmly disagree with the Court’s holding
today, the decision might not substantially constrain a
President’s ability to order tariffs going forward. That is
because numerous other federal statutes authorize the
President to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not
all) of the tariffs at issue in this case—albeit perhaps with
a few additional procedural steps that IEEPA, as an
emergency statute, does not require. Those statutes
include, for example, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962
(Section 232); the Trade Act of 1974 (Sections 122, 201, and

301); and the Tariff Act of 1930 (Section 338). In essence,
the Court today concludes that the President checked the
wrong statutory box by relying on IEEPA rather than
another statute to impose these tariffs.
In the meantime, however, the interim effects of the
Court’s decision could be substantial. The United States
may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers
who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers
may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.
As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process
is likely to be a “mess.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 153–155. In
addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs
have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of
dollars—including with foreign nations from China to the
United Kingdom to Japan, and more. The Court’s decision
could generate uncertainty regarding those trade
arrangements.
In any event, the only issue before the Court today is one
of law. In light of the statutory text, longstanding historical
practice, and relevant Supreme Court precedents, I would
conclude that IEEPA authorizes the President to “regulate
. . . importation” by imposing tariffs on foreign imports
during declared national emergencies. I therefore
respectfully dissent.1
I
Before turning to the specifics of IEEPA’s text, history,
and precedent, I briefly review several fundamental
constitutional principles about the roles of the three
branches of the U. S. Government with respect to this case.
First, the plaintiffs and their amici, echoed by the Court,
rhetorically emphasize that Article I, Section 8, of the
Constitution assigns Congress, not the President, authority
——————
1 In this dissent, when I refer to “THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion,” I am
referring to the parts of THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion that speak for only
three Justices—namely, Parts II–A–2 and III.

over tariffs. Ante, at 5. That rhetoric is a red herring in
this case because no one disputes the point. Everyone,
including the President, agrees that Congress possesses
constitutional authority over tariffs.
The important principle here, as everyone also
acknowledges, is that Congress may in turn authorize the
President to impose tariffs. Cf. FCC v. Consumers’
Research, 606 U. S. 656, 673–675 (2025); J. W. Hampton,
Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409–410 (1928).
Indeed, since the beginning of the Republic, Congress has
regularly empowered the President to order tariffs and
other foreign import restrictions under various
circumstances. As noted above, many current federal laws
continue to grant the President expansive tariff authority,
including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Section 232);
the Trade Act of 1974 (Sections 122, 201, and 301); and the
Tariff Act of 1930 (Section 338). Neither the plaintiffs nor
the Court has suggested that the numerous laws granting
tariff power to the President violate the Constitution’s
separation of powers.
Second, and relatedly, the President does not claim
unilateral authority to impose IEEPA tariffs without
congressional authorization or over a congressional
prohibition. On the contrary, the President’s argument
recognizes that, in exercising his statutory tariff power
under IEEPA, he must act within the scope of Congress’s
authorizations and abide by Congress’s limitations. And
the Executive has further acknowledged that the Judiciary
maintains the final word in justiciable cases on whether
Congress has authorized the President to impose those
tariffs under IEEPA. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U. S.
831, 859–860, n. 18 (2025); cf. Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137, 177–178 (1803).
The President here contends only that Congress, by
enacting IEEPA in 1977, authorized the President to
impose tariffs on foreign imports in declared national

emergencies. To use the familiar vernacular of Justice
Robert Jackson in Youngstown, the President argues that
this case falls into category one, where the President is
acting “pursuant to an express or implied authorization of
Congress.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (concurring opinion). The President
has not here asserted authority to impose IEEPA tariffs in
a peacetime emergency in a Youngstown category two or
three scenario. Id., at 637–638.2
Third, Congress possesses a variety of tools to limit the
President’s tariffs—directly via new legislation or, perhaps
more readily, by not approving annual appropriations
necessary for the Executive Branch to continue to
implement the tariffs. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S.
477, 505 (2023) (“Among Congress’s most important
authorities is its control of the purse”).
Importantly, the House, the Senate, and the President
annually approve most appropriations. As a result, each
House of Congress and the President independently
possesses de facto veto power over particular
appropriations.3
Of course, many different appropriations items are
usually considered and packaged together, so the
negotiations can be complex. But the point stands:
Congress is not a helpless bystander when it comes to the
President’s exercise of tariff authority under IEEPA. Cf.
Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2011, 124 Stat. 4351–4352 (barring Executive from
——————
2Category two applies when “the President acts in absence of either a
congressional grant or denial of authority.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at
637 (Jackson, J., concurring). Category three occurs when “the President
takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress.” Ibid.
3Two technical points for clarity: Given current Senate filibuster
rules, a determined minority of the Senate could block an appropriation.
Also, even over a Presidential veto, two-thirds of both Houses could
together approve certain appropriations.

using funds to transfer detainees from Guantanamo into
United States); Boland Amendment, 98 Stat. 1935–1936
(1984) (barring certain Executive Branch agencies from
providing aid to Contras in Nicaragua).
In Congress, moreover, everything is related to
everything else, as the saying goes. Members and
Committees of Congress possess substantial tools of
leverage over the Executive Branch. Cf. The Federalist No.
51, p. 322 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Congress
could, for example, wield its authority over oversight,
legislation, confirmations, or appropriations to pressure the
President to reduce or eliminate some or all of the IEEPA
tariffs.
In light of Congress’s appropriations authority and its
other robust powers, it is not correct to suggest—as THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion today elliptically does, ante, at 9—
that two-thirds majorities of both Houses of Congress would
need to pass new legislation over a Presidential veto in
order to limit these IEEPA tariffs or, more generally, to
restrict the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.
II
This case presents one straightforward question of
statutory interpretation: Does Congress’s explicit grant of
authority in IEEPA for the President to “regulate . . .
importation” of foreign goods in declared national
emergencies authorize the President to impose tariffs? The
answer is a clear yes.4
——————
4The relevant statutory provision provides in full:
“At the times and to the extent specified in section 1701 of this title,
the President may, under such regulations as he may prescribe, by means
of instructions, licenses, or otherwise—

“(B) investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation,
regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any

A
I begin as always with the statutory text.
In 1941, a few days after Pearl Harbor, Congress first
enacted the relevant language, “regulate . . . importation,”
in an amendment to the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act,
known as TWEA. 55 Stat. 839; 40 Stat. 411. After that
1941 amendment, TWEA authorized the President to
“regulate . . . importation” both during wartime and during
peacetime national emergencies.
Then, in 1977, Congress split TWEA into two separate
statutes. As relevant here, Congress amended TWEA to
authorize the President to “regulate . . . importation”
during wartime only. 91 Stat. 1625. And Congress enacted
a separate statute, IEEPA, that granted the President the
power to “regulate . . . importation” during peacetime
national emergencies. Id., at 1626.
The relevant IEEPA text authorized the President to
“regulate . . . importation” “by means of instructions,
licenses, or otherwise.” Ibid.; 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)
(emphasis added). As the term “otherwise” indicates, the
broadly worded statute did not exclude tariffs or dictate any
specific means of regulating importation.5
At the time of TWEA’s amendment in 1941 and IEEPA’s
enactment in 1977, the ordinary dictionary meaning of
“regulate” was to “control,” to “adjust by rule,” or to “subject
——————
acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal,
transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising
any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving,
any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any
interest by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States.” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1) (emphasis
added).
5Congress no doubt appreciated that quotas, embargoes, tariffs, and
the like can be powerful tools for regulating foreign commerce. Congress
calibrated the statute by exempting various categories of goods, meaning
that those categories of goods are not subject to tariffs under IEEPA.
§1702(b).

to governing principles or laws.” Black’s Law Dictionary
1156 (5th ed. 1979); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1519
(3d ed. 1933) (same); Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary 1913 (1976) (defining “regulate” as “to govern or
direct according to rule” and “to bring under the control of
law or constituted authority”); American Heritage
Dictionary 1096 (1969) (“[t]o control or direct according to a
rule”; “[t]o adjust in conformity to a specification or
requirement”).
Imposing tariffs on imports is clearly a way of controlling
imports (Black’s); governing or directing imports according
to rule (Webster’s, American Heritage); adjusting imports
by rule, method, or established mode (Black’s, American
Heritage); or more generally subjecting imports to
governing principles or laws (Black’s). So the dictionary
definitions amply demonstrate that tariffs are a means to
“regulate . . . importation” of foreign imports.6
Consistent with those dictionary definitions and
statutory references, tariffs historically have been—and
still are—a common means for the United States to
regulate importation of foreign goods. See, e.g., Section 338
of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 704–706 (19 U. S. C.
§1338); Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, 76
Stat. 877 (19 U. S. C. §1862); Title II of the Trade Act of
1974, 88 Stat. 2011 (19 U. S. C. §2251 et seq.); Title III of
the Trade Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 2041 (19 U. S. C. §2411
et seq.).7
——————
6As other statutory authorities textually confirm, moreover, Congress
has long understood tariffs to be a tool for regulating imports. For
example, Section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930 refers to “duties and other
import restrictions.” 19 U. S. C. §§1351(a)(1)(B), (c). And Section 122 of
the Trade Act of 1974 uses the phrase “restrict imports” to cover duties.
§2132(a). Both statutes take it as a given, therefore, that tariffs are a
means of regulating imports.
7As the parties and the Court use the terms, “tariffs” and “duties” are
synonymous.

In determining the ordinary meaning of “regulate
. . . importation,” the meaning of the related phrase
“regulate commerce” is also instructive. That phrase has
long been interpreted to encompass tariffs. Since the
Founding, the Constitution’s assignment to Congress of the
broad power to “regulate” foreign commerce has been
understood to include tariffs on foreign imports. See Art. I,
§8. As Chief Justice Marshall explained, the “right to
regulate commerce, even by the imposition of duties, was not
controverted.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824)
(emphasis added). So too Justice Story: The “power to
regulate commerce includes the power of laying duties to
countervail the regulations and restrictions of foreign
nations.” 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of
the United States 530 (1833) (emphasis added). And still
more Story: To “lay duties” is a “common means of
executing the power” to “regulate commerce.” Id., at 531
(emphasis added). James Madison likewise stated that it
cannot “be inferred” that the “power to regulate trade does
not involve a power to tax it.” Letter from J. Madison to J.
Cabell, Sept. 18, 1828, in 9 Writings of James Madison 326
(G. Hunt ed. 1910) (emphasis added).
Marshall, Story, and Madison make for a formidable trio.
And this Court has long echoed the Marshall-Story-
Madison understanding that tariffs “regulate” foreign
commerce. The “laying of a duty on imports, although an
exercise of the taxing power, is also an exercise of the power
to regulate foreign commerce.” McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil
Corp., 309 U. S. 414, 428 (1940) (emphasis added). And
again: Even though “the taxing power is a distinct power
and embraces the power to lay duties, it does not follow that
duties may not be imposed in the exercise of the power to
regulate commerce. The contrary is well established.”

Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U. S.
48, 58 (1933) (emphasis added).8
The plaintiffs and the Court today seize on the word
“regulate” in isolation, and say that it does not encompass
the power to tariff. Ante, at 14–16. But the relevant
statutory phrase is “regulate . . . importation.” And we
must look to the meaning of the phrase as a whole, as our
precedents dictate. See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. 397,
406 (2011) (“[T]wo words together may assume a more
particular meaning than those words in isolation”). As I
have explained, since the Founding, tariffs on foreign
imports have been a common means of regulating foreign
commerce, including imports. Notably, under the Court’s
reading of the word “regulate,” Marshall, Story, and
Madison all erred by concluding that the power to
“regulate” foreign commerce includes the power to impose
tariffs on foreign imports. That seems dubious.
If the Federal Government’s constitutional power to
“regulate” foreign commerce includes tariffs (as this Court
has repeatedly said), and if the power to “regulate . . .
importation” is the power to regulate foreign commerce
with respect to imports (as it plainly is), then IEEPA’s
authorization for the President to “regulate . . .
importation” clearly encompasses tariffs. Historical usage
and that textual syllogism further buttress the dictionary
definitions and help establish that tariffs are a means to
regulate importation.9
——————
8Importantly, those historical sources also fully demonstrate that the
Foreign Commerce Clause, not just the Taxing Clause, authorizes tariffs
on foreign imports. See Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill., 289 U. S., at
58.
9The plaintiffs and the Court offer a double-bankshot argument that
“regulate . . . importation” cannot include monetary exactions because
IEEPA also authorizes the President to “regulate . . . exportation,” and
imposing duties on exports would violate the Constitution. Ante, at 15.
But as the Government thoroughly explains, when a statute contains a

B
Perhaps even more significantly, when IEEPA was
enacted in 1977, Congress and the public clearly would
have understood that the phrase “regulate . . . importation”
encompassed tariffs. We know as much not only because of
the dictionary definitions and the traditional
understanding of tariffs as a tool to regulate foreign
imports. We also know as much because of tariffs imposed
by two Presidents and approved by federal courts, including
the Supreme Court, in the years shortly before IEEPA’s
1977 enactment.
First, in 1971, President Nixon imposed 10 percent tariffs
across the board on virtually all imports from every country
in the world. Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 3 CFR
60–61 (1971–1975 Comp.). Those tariffs were justified
under IEEPA’s predecessor statute, the Trading with the
Enemy Act, or TWEA.10 Like IEEPA now, TWEA at that
time authorized the President to “regulate . . . importation”
during national emergencies, as well as wartime. And like
IEEPA now, TWEA did not specifically use the words
“tariff ” or “duty.”
——————
long string of verbs and nouns, each term should be understood in
context. The relevant section of IEEPA contains 9 verbs and 11 objects,
for a total of 99 combinations. We do not need to construe each word of
the statute to ensure that it is perfectly aligned in all 99 pairings. See
Reply Brief 17; Robers v. United States, 572 U. S. 639, 643–644 (2014);
Department of Agriculture Rural Development Rural Housing Service v.
Kirtz, 601 U. S. 42, 61 (2024) (We may not “disregard the statute’s clear
terms” simply because there may be “a valid constitutional defense” to
some applications).
10President Nixon did not explicitly cite the “regulate . . . importation”
language of TWEA when imposing those worldwide tariffs. But that
merely reflected a diplomatic nicety given the title of the “Trading with
the Enemy Act” and the desire to avoid publicly suggesting that allies
were enemies. Once in court, the President openly invoked the “regulate
. . . importation” language of TWEA as justification for the tariffs. See
United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 569–571 (CCPA 1975).

The Nixon tariffs did not fly below the radar. On the
contrary, President Nixon announced the worldwide 10
percent tariffs in a primetime address to the Nation on
August 15, 1971. He imposed the tariffs as a tool “to make
certain that American products will not be at a
disadvantage” and that “the product of American labor will
be more competitive.” Public Papers of the Presidents,
Richard Nixon, Aug. 15, 1971, p. 889. President Nixon
sought to remove “the unfair edge that some of our foreign
competition has,” and he declared that when “the unfair
treatment is ended, the import tax will end.” Ibid.
The Nixon tariffs applied to almost all imports of foreign
goods into the United States. And the tariffs had no time
limit. To be sure, they did not end up lasting forever. But
President Nixon terminated them only because the tariffs
(as intended) induced major American trading partners to
negotiate new agreements. Presidential Proclamation No.
4098, 3 CFR 94 (1971–1975 Comp.).
The Nixon tariffs garnered substantial national and
international attention, and were generally popular in
Congress. Predictably, however, the tariffs sparked
litigation challenges. In 1975, the Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals, the predecessor to the Federal Circuit,
upheld the Nixon tariffs as a lawful exercise of the
President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation” under
TWEA. United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560,
576, 583–584. The losing plaintiffs did not seek further
review in this Court.
Two years later in 1977, when Congress divided TWEA
into two, Congress retained that same “regulate . . .
importation” language in both laws—in TWEA for wartime
and in IEEPA for peacetime national emergencies. In doing
so, Members of Congress were plainly aware—after all, how
could they not be—that the “regulate . . . importation”
language had recently been invoked by the President and
interpreted by the courts to encompass tariffs. Indeed, the

House Committee Report noted that the relevant “regulate
. . . importation” provision in TWEA “came into play when,
on August 15, 1971, President Nixon declared a national
emergency with respect to the balance-of-payments crisis
and under that emergency imposed a surcharge on
imports.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–459, p. 5 (1977). The Report
further referenced the appeals court’s holding in Yoshida
that TWEA “authorized imposition of duties” because of
“the existence of the national emergency.” H. R. Rep. No.
95–459, at 5.11
The Nixon tariffs persuasively demonstrate that
Members of Congress and the public would have
understood the phrase “regulate . . . importation” to include
tariffs when IEEPA was enacted in 1977. If Congress
wanted to exclude tariffs from IEEPA’s scope, why would it
enact the exact statutory language from TWEA that had
just been invoked by the President and interpreted by the
courts to cover tariffs? Neither the plaintiffs nor the Court
today offers a good answer to that question.
Understandably so, because there is no good answer.
The Court tries to dodge the force of the Nixon tariffs by
observing that one appeals court’s interpretation of
“regulate . . . importation” to uphold President Nixon’s
tariffs does not suffice to describe that interpretation as
“well-settled” when IEEPA was enacted in 1977. Ante, at
17–18. Fair enough. But that is not the right question. The
question is what Members of Congress and the public would
have understood “regulate . . . importation” to mean when
Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977. See New Prime Inc. v.
Oliveira, 586 U. S. 105, 113 (2019). Given the significant
and well-known Nixon tariffs, it is entirely implausible to
——————
11I cite the Committee Report not for determining the meaning of
IEEPA, but rather to help show as an historical and factual matter that
Members of Congress were aware of both the Nixon tariffs and the
appeals court decision upholding those tariffs as a tool to “regulate . . .
importation.”

think that Congress’s 1977 re-enactment of the phrase
“regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA was somehow meant
or understood to exclude tariffs.12
Second, if one holds any lingering doubts about
Congress’s and the public’s understanding of the power to
“regulate . . . importation” as of 1977, a second episode
shortly before IEEPA’s enactment should answer them.
In 1975, President Ford imposed significant monetary
exactions on foreign imports of oil. Presidential
Proclamation No. 4341, 3 CFR 433 (1971–1975 Comp.). He
acted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
Like TWEA and IEEPA, the relevant provision of Section
232 did not use the word “tariff ” or “duty.” Rather, Section
232 broadly authorized the President to “adjust the
imports” of a product, 19 U. S. C. §1862(b) (1970 ed.)—
language akin to the “regulate . . . importation” language in
IEEPA and TWEA.
In contrast to the Nixon tariffs, the Ford tariffs on oil
imports generated some pushback in Congress. And a
group of utility companies and States quickly sued, arguing
that the relevant statutory phrase “adjust the imports” did
not authorize monetary exactions such as tariffs.
Over a dissent, the D. C. Circuit agreed with the
plaintiffs challenging the Ford tariffs. Much like the
Court’s decision today, the D. C. Circuit in the Ford matter
concluded that Congress must explicitly authorize
monetary exactions and that the applicable statutory
phrase, “adjust the imports,” did not do so. Algonquin SNG,
——————
12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion also tries to dismiss President Nixon’s
tariffs as being of “limited amount, duration, and scope.” Ante, at 10, n.
3. That claim appears incorrect on all three points, as Judge Taranto
carefully explained in his Federal Circuit opinion. 149 F. 4th 1312,
1367–1369 (2025) (dissenting opinion). President Nixon imposed 10
percent tariffs on virtually all imports from every country in the world
for an unspecified duration. See Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 3
CFR 60–61 (1971–1975 Comp.).

Inc. v. Federal Energy Admin., 518 F. 2d 1051, 1055 (CADC
1975).
In 1976, the Ford tariffs case came to the Supreme Court.
In this Court, the plaintiffs pressed nearly identical
arguments (and rhetorical flourishes) as those advanced by
the plaintiffs and repeated by the Court in today’s case.
The plaintiffs argued that the Ford-imposed monetary
exactions involved “the broadest exercise of the tariff power
in the history of the American Republic,” reminiscent of
“George III’s stamp tax.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in Federal Energy
Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., O. T. 1975, No. 75–
382, p. 26. They contended that the statute’s authorization
for the President to “adjust the imports” did not allow for
such monetary exactions because the statute did “not
mention the tariff on its face.” Ibid. They asserted that this
Court had “never implied a tax, never in the history of this
Court from language which does not explicitly provide for
tax, and here there is no such language, there is no
language that mentions a measure of tax nor a method of
calculation of tax. There is no such thing.” Id., at 33. They
echoed the D. C. Circuit’s holding that reading the phrase
“adjust the imports” to encompass tariffs would be “an
anomalous departure” from “the consistently explicit, well-
defined manner in which Congress has delegated control
over foreign trade and tariffs.” Algonquin, 518 F. 2d, at
1055. And they claimed that interpreting the statute to
include fees “undermines the whole tariff structure of the
United States.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in Algonquin, at 26.
Importantly, the Algonquin plaintiffs acknowledged (as
do the plaintiffs and the Court in today’s case) that the
statutory language “adjust the imports” would allow the
President to impose quotas and embargoes on foreign
imports. See Brief for Respondents in Algonquin, No. 75–
382, pp. 26–27, and n. 30. So a President could completely
block all imports or limit their quantity. But according to
the plaintiffs, Congress’s “adjust the imports” language

precluded the President from exercising the lesser power of
imposing monetary exactions such as tariffs.
The Supreme Court decided the Ford tariffs case in 1976.
The Court unanimously reversed the D. C. Circuit and
flatly rejected the plaintiffs’ arguments. The Court held
that the statutory phrase “adjust the imports”—even
though it did not include terms such as “tariff,” “tax,”
“duty,” or “fee”—granted President Ford the authority to
impose not only quotas and embargoes, but also monetary
exactions on foreign imports. Federal Energy
Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548, 561
(1976).
The Court analyzed the statutory text and found “no
support in the language of the statute” for the plaintiffs’
argument that “adjust the imports” should “be read to
encompass only quantitative methods—i.e., quotas—as
opposed to monetary methods—i.e., license fees—of
effecting such adjustments.” Ibid. The Court further
explained: “Unless one assumes, and we do not, that quotas
will always be a feasible method of dealing directly with
national security threats posed by the circumstances under
which imports are entering the country, limiting the
President to the use of quotas would effectively and
artificially prohibit him from directly dealing with some of
the very problems against which §232(b) is directed.” Id.,
at 561–562 (quotation marks omitted).
In short, according to the unanimous Algonquin Court,
the statutory text, structure, and logic of Section 232
definitively established that the President’s authority to
“adjust the imports” encompassed not only quotas and
embargoes, but also monetary exactions such as tariffs and
fees.
Today’s case should follow a fortiori from Algonquin. No
meaningful daylight exists between the statutory phrase
“adjust the imports” in Section 232 at issue in Algonquin
and the phrase “regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA at

issue here. The plaintiffs and the Court in this case do not
even try to distinguish “adjust the imports” from “regulate
. . . importation.” Nor could they. Recall that the dictionary
definition of “regulate” includes “adjust by rule.” Black’s
Law Dictionary, at 1156 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added).
To adjust imports is to regulate imports. Indeed, if
anything, the phrase “regulate . . . importation” is broader
in scope than the phrase “adjust the imports.”
So if Section 232’s “adjust the imports” includes tariffs—
as this Court unanimously concluded in Algonquin in 1976
just a year before IEEPA—how can IEEPA’s “regulate . . .
importation” not include tariffs?
Algonquin’s importance for today’s case rests not merely
on its status as a unanimous on-point Supreme Court
statutory precedent—although it is surely significant for
that reason as well. The case is especially consequential for
present purposes because it helps show the ordinary public
and congressional understanding of “regulate . . .
importation” in 1977 when Congress enacted IEEPA.
To be clear, the question here is not what individual
Members of Congress might have subjectively intended in
1977. The question is the ordinary meaning and
understanding of the words that Congress used. Given that
the phrase “adjust the imports”—again, in a statutory
provision that did not use specific words such as “tariff ” or
“duty”—was unanimously held by this Court in 1976 to
include tariffs, and given that President Nixon had
similarly relied on his statutory authority to “regulate . . .
importation” to impose 10 percent tariffs on virtually all
imports from all countries, could a rational citizen or
Member of Congress in 1977 have understood “regulate . . .
importation” in IEEPA not to encompass tariffs? I think
not. Any citizens or Members of Congress in 1977 who
somehow thought that the “regulate . . . importation”
language in IEEPA excluded tariffs would have had their
heads in the sand.

The Court today tries its best to distinguish Algonquin on
the ground that Section 232 included “sweeping” language
authorizing the President to take “such action” that “he
deems necessary,” whereas IEEPA does not. Ante, at 19.
But the Algonquin Court did not rely on that language and
instead focused on whether the phrase “adjust the imports”
included monetary exactions. See 426 U. S., at 561.
Moreover, IEEPA itself broadly authorizes the President to
“regulate . . . importation” “by means of instructions,
licenses, or otherwise” in order to “deal with” an “unusual
and extraordinary” foreign “threat” to the “national
security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.”
50 U. S. C. §§1701(a), 1702(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). That
language is similarly expansive, authorizing the President
to employ various tools to “regulate . . . importation.” In
short, just as the phrase “adjust the imports” includes
tariffs, as Algonquin held, so too the phrase “regulate . . .
importation” includes tariffs.13
The Court also attempts to brush aside Algonquin by
citing an entirely different provision of the Trade
Expansion Act—one that was not at issue in Algonquin—
that expressly refers to a “duty.” Ante, at 19. But the
Algonquin Court did not rely on—or even mention—that
provision when concluding that the statutory phrase
“adjust the imports” includes tariffs. For good reason. That
provision, which states that “[n]o action shall be taken” to
“decrease or eliminate” an existing “duty or other import
restriction,” 19 U. S. C. §1862(a) (1970 ed.), concerns only
the power to reduce existing tariffs and plainly does not
bear on a President’s power to impose tariffs under Section
232.
——————
13In addition, IEEPA expressly authorizes the President to require
licenses. And to obtain a license, a business may need to pay license fees
that can be equivalent to tariffs. See §1702(a)(1).

To sum up on the Nixon and Ford tariffs: When enacting
IEEPA in 1977, Congress employed the exact language
recently invoked by President Nixon to justify 10 percent
worldwide tariffs. And IEEPA came fast on the heels of this
Court’s unanimous 1976 decision in Algonquin, which held
that substantially similar “adjust the imports” language
authorized President Ford’s tariffs on oil imports.
Importantly, moreover, the statutory provisions
authorizing the Nixon and Ford tariffs did not use specific
words such as “tariff ” or “duty.”
The Nixon and Ford tariffs, this Court’s decision in
Algonquin, and the ordinary and historical understanding
of tariffs as a means of regulating imports together render
it all but impossible to conclude that Congress in 1977
implicitly excluded tariffs when retaining TWEA’s
“regulate . . . importation” language in IEEPA. If Congress
in 1977 wanted to exclude tariffs from the President’s
IEEPA toolkit, either it would have not retained the phrase
“regulate . . . importation,” or it would otherwise have made
clear in IEEPA that the power to impose tariffs was
excluded. Congress did neither.
C
Two additional historical points strongly reinforce that
analysis of text and precedent and further demonstrate
that “regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA encompasses
tariffs.
First, U. S. history from the 1800s through IEEPA’s 1977
enactment illustrates how the statute came to incorporate
the President’s long-recognized authority to impose tariffs
during wartime and then also during peacetime national
emergencies.
Long before the initial 1917 enactment of the Trading
with the Enemy Act, which was IEEPA’s predecessor, the
President possessed inherent wartime authority to prohibit
commercial relations with enemy nations. That inherent

authority included the power to impose tariffs on foreign
imports.
For example, during the Mexican-American War in the
1840s, President Polk permitted only limited trade with
Mexico, subject to tariffs. Some Members of Congress
publicly questioned whether the President possessed that
tariff authority. In response, President Polk justified the
tariffs on the ground that “the military right to exclude
commerce altogether from the ports of the enemy in our
military occupation included the minor right of admitting it
under prescribed conditions.” J. Polk, To the House of
Representatives of the United States (Jan. 2, 1849), in 6
Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents
2522, 2523 (J. Richardson ed. 1897).
In 1854, the Supreme Court agreed with President Polk’s
view, stating: “No one can doubt” that the President, as
“commander-in-chief of our naval force,” possessed the
authority to “regulate import duties.” Cross v. Harrison, 16
How. 164, 189–190.
In 1862, President Lincoln partially lifted an existing
blockade against the Confederate States during the Civil
War. Like President Polk, he then permitted limited trade,
subject to a monetary fee. A group of cotton sellers later
sued, arguing that the fee “was essentially a tax and not
authorized by any act of Congress, which alone had the
power to impose taxes.” Hamilton v. Dillin, 21 Wall. 73, 81
(1875). The Supreme Court rejected that argument,
holding that there was “no question” that requiring a
monetary fee to trade with the Confederate States was part
of “the war power of the United States government.” Id., at
86–87. The existence of war meant “a suspension of
commercial intercourse between the opposing sections of
the country,” so if “such a course of dealing were to be
permitted at all, it would necessarily be upon such
conditions as the government chose to prescribe.” Id., at 87.

And in 1898, during the Spanish-American War,
President McKinley imposed duties “upon the occupation of
any forts and places in the Philippine Islands.” Lincoln v.
United States, 197 U. S. 419, 428 (1905) (quotation marks
omitted). This Court subsequently recognized those
McKinley duties as a lawful wartime measure. Id., at 427–
428.
Why does that wartime history matter? Because when
Congress first enacted the Trading with the Enemy Act in
1917 during World War I, it statutorily codified some of the
President’s longstanding inherent wartime powers over
foreign trade, which included the power to tariff. See
Trading with the Enemy Act, ch. 106, 40 Stat. 411; see also
Brief for Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae 16–19,
26–27. For the duration of World War I, TWEA authorized
the President, when he found “the public safety so
requires,” to make it unlawful “to import into the United
States” from any “named” country certain goods “except at
such time or times, and under such regulations or orders,
and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the
President shall prescribe.” §11, 40 Stat. 422–423.
In 1933, during the Great Depression and five days after
President Franklin Roosevelt took office, Congress
expanded TWEA to apply not only in wartime, but also
during a “national emergency” declared by the President.
48 Stat. 1.
Eight years later, in 1941, a few days after Pearl Harbor,
Congress again amended TWEA’s language by more
succinctly providing that the President may “regulate”
certain transactions, including “importation,” under TWEA
during war or “any other period of national emergency
declared by the President.” 55 Stat. 839.
So as of 1941—and from then to 1977—TWEA expressly
authorized the President to “regulate . . . importation” both
during wartime and during peacetime national
emergencies. Historically, Presidents had regulated

importation by imposing tariffs, as the Polk, Lincoln, and
McKinley tariffs illustrated. So TWEA from 1941 to 1977
was best understood to authorize tariffs. See Brief for
Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae 27–28.
During that period, as I have discussed at length above,
President Nixon in 1971 imposed 10 percent tariffs on
almost all imports of foreign goods and relied on TWEA’s
“regulate . . . importation” language to justify them. Those
tariffs were upheld in court.
Then, in 1977, Congress amended TWEA and divided it
into two statutes. TWEA retained the President’s power to
“regulate . . . importation,” but only during wartime. The
newly enacted second law, IEEPA, also retained the power
to “regulate . . . importation,” and it would apply during
periods of declared national emergencies. As this Court has
previously recognized, IEEPA was “directly drawn” from
TWEA, and the relevant authorities are essentially the
same. Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 671, 672–
673 (1981).
Therefore, IEEPA’s specific language—“regulate . . .
importation”—was not new statutory text when Congress
enacted IEEPA in 1977. Far from it. Beginning in 1941,
TWEA had already authorized the President to “regulate
. . . importation” of foreign goods in wartime and national
emergencies. And the earlier Polk, Lincoln, and McKinley
examples, as well as the later Nixon example,
demonstrated that the power to “regulate . . . importation”
historically encompassed tariffs as well as quotas and
embargoes.
The plaintiffs and the Court today assert that wartime
precedents do not govern peacetime. But Congress modeled
IEEPA on TWEA precisely so that the President could
continue to exercise certain wartime authorities such as
quotas, embargoes, and tariffs during peacetime national
emergencies as well. Congress first explicitly extended that
wartime power to national emergencies in 1933, during the

Franklin Roosevelt Administration. Cf. New State Ice Co.
v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 306 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting) (The Great Depression was “an emergency more
serious than war”). And Congress has continued to
authorize the President to exercise that power in both
wartime and peacetime emergencies.
In short, Congress in 1977 enacted the same “regulate . . .
importation” language that had long been understood to
encompass tariffs.
Second, contrary to the tenor of the plaintiffs’ and the
Court’s arguments here, it would not have been at all
unusual or surprising for Congress, when enacting IEEPA
in 1977, to authorize the President to impose tariffs. Since
the early days of the Republic, Congress has regularly
granted the President the power to regulate foreign trade,
including via tariffs.
A few examples: In 1810, Congress authorized the
President to prohibit imports from Great Britain or France
if either nation violated the neutral commerce of the United
States. Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch
382, 382–384, 388 (1813); 2 Stat. 606.
In 1890, Congress granted the President the power to
impose import duties in response to duties imposed by other
countries on American exports. Marshall Field & Co. v.
Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 680–681 (1892); 26 Stat. 612.
In 1922, Congress empowered the President to levy
import duties under certain conditions. J. W. Hampton, Jr.,
& Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 400–402 (1928); 42
Stat. 941.
In 1930, Congress enacted Section 338 of the Tariff Act,
which authorizes the President to impose tariffs when he
finds that “any foreign country places any burden or
disadvantage upon the commerce of the United States.” 19
U. S. C. §1338(d); 46 Stat. 705.
In 1962, Congress authorized the President in Section
232 of the Trade Expansion Act to “adjust the imports” of a

foreign good that threatens to impair national security.
§1862(c)(1)(A); 76 Stat. 877.
In 1974, under Section 201 of the Trade Act, Congress
granted the President the power to “take all appropriate
and feasible action within his power,” including imposing a
“duty” on imports that, according to the U. S. International
Trade Commission, have caused or threatened “serious
injury” to a domestic industry. §§2251(a), 2253(a)(1)(A),
(3)(A); 88 Stat. 2014–2015.
So too, Section 301 authorizes the President to direct the
U. S. Trade Representative to “impose duties” on countries
engaging in unfair trade practices. §§2411(a), (c)(1)(B); 88
Stat. 2041–2042.
And Section 122 of the Act grants the President the power
to impose a “temporary import surcharge” to “deal with
large and serious United States balance-of-payment
deficits.” §2132(a)(1)(A); 88 Stat. 1987–1988.
Those many statutes definitively establish that Congress,
since near the Founding, has delegated to the President
broad power to impose tariffs on foreign imports. See also
ante, at 13–15 (). So it would hardly
have been unusual or surprising for Congress to have
granted tariff power to the President during wartime and
peacetime national emergencies, as it did in TWEA and
IEEPA.
To be sure, given those other statutes that authorize the
President to impose tariffs on foreign imports, one might
reasonably ask: Why did the President need distinct tariff
authority under IEEPA during peacetime emergencies—or,
for that matter, under TWEA during wartime?
The basic answer is that IEEPA is an emergency statute
that allows the President to impose tariffs somewhat more
quickly, as would be expected in a declared national
emergency. Similarly, in wartime, TWEA allows the
President to impose tariffs more rapidly.

But critically, TWEA and IEEPA do not authorize the
President to exercise some new substantive power. Rather,
they authorize the President to exercise a commonly
granted power—tariffs—more efficiently than under the
many ordinary tariff statutes.
The plaintiffs and the Court assert that interpreting
IEEPA to authorize tariffs would in effect evade specific
limits on tariffs in certain other tariff statutes. But as
Judge Taranto explained in the Federal Circuit, Congress
in IEEPA understandably afforded the President more
flexibility to act during declared emergencies, just as
Congress had done in TWEA for wartime since 1917. See
149 F. 4th 1312, 1363–1366 (2025) (dissenting opinion).
Moreover, IEEPA is not a blank check. IEEPA contains
its own limits, including the requirement that the tariffs
deal with an unusual and extraordinary foreign threat, 50
U. S. C. §1701(b); a default 1-year limit on emergencies,
§1622(d); an enumerated list of exceptions, §1702(b); and
comprehensive congressional reporting requirements,
§1703. And as noted above, each House of Congress
possesses a variety of tools to revoke, limit, or influence a
President’s IEEPA or TWEA tariffs.
Relatedly, it is also not surprising that the many ordinary
tariff statutes expressly refer to “tariffs,” “duties,” and the
like, while IEEPA and TWEA do not. As Judge Taranto
astutely explained, “Congress in those statutes was
overwhelmingly focused on tariff issues,” whereas
“Congress in IEEPA (as in TWEA) was focused on the
subject of emergencies and giving plainly broad emergency
authority regarding foreign property.” 149 F. 4th, at 1364
(dissenting opinion).
In sum, in authorizing the President to “regulate . . .
importation,” IEEPA embodies an “eyes-open congressional
grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs
realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities
available under non-emergency laws, and Congress

confirmed the understood breadth by tying IEEPA’s
authority to particularly demanding procedural
requirements for keeping Congress informed.” Id., at 1348.
D
Finally, all of that text, history, and precedent is further
reinforced by two compelling pieces of context.
First, interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates
nonsensical textual and practical anomalies. The plaintiffs
and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in
declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or
even total embargoes on all imports from a given country.
But the President supposedly cannot take the far more
modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a
tariff or duty.
Textually, however, if quotas and embargoes are a means
to regulate importation, how are tariffs not a means to
regulate importation? Nothing in the text supports such an
illogical distinction.
And it does not make much sense to think that IEEPA
allows the President in a declared national emergency to,
for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but
not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China. As
Judge Taranto forcefully pointed out in the Federal Circuit,
tariffs are “just a less extreme, more flexible tool for
pursuing the same objective of controlling the amount or
price of imports that, after all, could be barred altogether.”
149 F. 4th, at 1363 (dissenting opinion). All of that explains
why this Court in Algonquin definitively rejected such a
strange slice-and-dice approach to the President’s statutory
power to “adjust” imports. If quotas and embargoes are
authorized, so are tariffs.
In short, whether through prohibiting imports via
embargoes or regulating the quantity of imports through
quotas or regulating the price of imports with tariffs,
Congress granted the President flexibility in declared

national emergencies to take various actions affecting
imports of foreign goods. The plaintiffs and the Court have
no coherent textual or commonsensical explanation for why
a rational Congress would, in such a momentous and
carefully considered statute as IEEPA, grant the President
the power to impose quotas and embargoes, but not tariffs,
on foreign imports during emergencies.
Second, IEEPA was not debated and passed in a vacuum
in 1977—it was enacted around the same time that
Congress significantly constrained executive power in
multiple ways in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam. The
list of major new statutory restrictions on Presidential
power enacted in the 1970s is long and extraordinary, with
lasting effects to the present day.14
And Congress, during that comprehensive examination
and recalibration of government power, did not overlook
TWEA and the President’s emergency authorities. Led by
Senators Church and Mathias, Congress carefully studied
the President’s emergency authorities, including TWEA.
Then, in 1976 and 1977, Congress enacted a variety of
legislation to tighten up the President’s emergency powers,
including by passing a new National Emergencies Act that
cabined the President’s authority to declare emergencies by
setting forth various procedural requirements.
Yet when enacting IEEPA in 1977, Congress continued to
grant the President the power to “regulate . . . importation”

in declared national emergencies—a power that the
President had possessed since 1941 under TWEA and that
had recently been invoked by President Nixon to justify his
1971 tariffs. In IEEPA (and TWEA) in 1977, Congress
consciously balanced concerns about expansive exercises of
emergency powers against the necessity of equipping the
President with tools to address exigencies that are difficult
if not impossible to foresee. That broader congressional
context—general skepticism and scaling back of executive
power combined with re-enactment of the familiar “regulate
. . . importation” language in IEEPA—strongly indicates
that Congress said what it meant and meant what it said
when it enacted IEEPA and continued to authorize the
President to “regulate . . . importation” during national
emergencies.
III
In an ordinary statutory interpretation case, I am
confident that a majority of this Court would flatly reject
the plaintiffs’ exceedingly weak statutory arguments and
would hold that IEEPA’s authorization for the President to
“regulate . . . importation” during national emergencies
includes the power to impose tariffs.
Notably, the Court today does not claim that the phrase
“regulate . . . importation” on its own excludes tariffs as a
matter of ordinary statutory meaning. Only three Members
of the Court, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and
JUSTICE JACKSON, do so.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion in Part II–A–2, which is
joined only by JUSTICE GORSUCH and JUSTICE BARRETT,
instead relies on the major questions doctrine. The major
questions doctrine is an important canon of statutory
interpretation that the Court has applied in a number of
significant cases over the last 45 years. See Industrial
Union Dept., AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum Institute,
448 U. S. 607, 645 (1980) (plurality opinion).

Justice Scalia articulated the canonical statement of the
major questions doctrine: “We expect Congress to speak
clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast
‘economic and political significance.’” Utility Air
Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 324 (2014)
(quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529
U. S. 120, 160 (2000)); see also Alabama Assn. of Realtors
v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. 758,
764 (2021) (per curiam); National Federation of
Independent Business v. OSHA, 595 U. S. 109, 117 (2022)
(per curiam); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 507 (2023);
cf. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (2022).
Stated otherwise, in cases where the Executive Branch
takes an action of major economic and political significance,
it must “point to ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the
power it claims.” Ibid. (quoting Utility Air, 573 U. S., at
324).
The requirement of “clear congressional authorization”
for executive actions of major economic and political
significance is “grounded in two overlapping and
reinforcing presumptions: (i) a separation of powers-based
presumption against the delegation of major lawmaking
authority from Congress to the Executive Branch, and (ii) a
presumption that Congress intends to make major policy
decisions itself, not leave those decisions to agencies.”
United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 855 F. 3d 381, 419
(CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of
rehearing en banc) (citation omitted). As this Court later
recounted in West Virginia, “both separation of powers
principles and a practical understanding of legislative
intent make us reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory
text the delegation claimed to be lurking there.” 597 U. S.,

at 723 (quotation marks omitted).15 The doctrine guards
“against unintentional, oblique, or otherwise unlikely
delegations of the legislative power.” NFIB, 595 U. S., at
125 ().16
I agree that this case involves an executive action of
major economic and political significance—which is
typically the trigger for requiring “clear congressional
authorization.” But in my respectful view, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s opinion’s application of the major questions
doctrine in this case is incorrect for two alternative and
independent reasons. First, the statutory text, history, and
precedent constitute “clear congressional authorization” for
the President to impose tariffs as a means to “regulate . . .
importation.” Second, and in the alternative, the major
questions doctrine does not apply in the foreign affairs
context. In the foreign affairs realm, courts recognize that
Congress often deliberately grants flexibility and discretion
to the President to pursue America’s interests. In that
context, courts therefore engage in “routine” textualist
statutory interpretation—reading the text as written—and
do not employ the major questions doctrine as a thumb on
the scale against the President. West Virginia, 597 U. S.,
at 724.
——————
15The major questions doctrine has also been analogized to, among
other things, the mischief rule, the absurdity doctrine, common sense,
and context. See, e.g., S. Bray, The Mischief Rule, 109 Geo. L. J. 967,
1011 (2021) (doctrine “has an essential similarity with the mischief
rule”); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 511 (2023) (BARRETT, J.,
concurring) (context, common sense).
16I have long been, and fully remain, a strong proponent of the major
questions doctrine. See United States Telecom, 855 F. 3d, at 418–426
(opinion of Kavanaugh, J.); Loving v. IRS, 742 F. 3d 1013, 1021 (CADC
2014); Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, No. 9–1322
(CADC, Dec. 20, 2012), pp. 9–10 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial
of rehearing en banc).

Because the major questions doctrine demands “clear
congressional authorization,” this Court has repeatedly
recognized that the doctrine is “distinct” from “routine
statutory interpretation.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 724
(quotation marks omitted). Importantly, therefore, the
doctrine applies—and makes a meaningful difference—only
in cases where the Executive’s “reading of a statute”
“would, under more ordinary circumstances, be upheld.”
Ibid. (quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 740, 742,
n. 3 (); M. Sohoni, The Major
Questions Quartet, 136 Harv. L. Rev. 262, 272–276 (2022).
To properly set up the inquiry: A major questions issue
arises when: (i) the Executive relies on the text of a
generally worded statute to exercise a specific power of
major economic and political significance; (ii) the generally
worded statute does not explicitly mention the specific
major power, but (iii) the asserted major power falls within
the generally worded text of the statute such that the
Executive’s assertion of that power “would, under more
ordinary circumstances, be upheld,” West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 724 (majority opinion) (quotation marks omitted).17
The question then is whether the generally worded
statute supplies “clear congressional authorization” for the
Executive to exercise that specific—but not explicitly
mentioned—major power. Here, for example, does the
generally worded statutory authorization for the President
to “regulate . . . importation” clearly authorize the
President to impose tariffs?
——————
17Of course, if the major power does not fall within the generally
worded text as a matter of ordinary statutory interpretation, the major
questions doctrine is not implicated or necessary to apply because the
Government’s statutory argument fails to begin with.

The requirement of “clear congressional authorization” is
easy enough to state. But how do we apply it? How do we
decide in a particular case whether a generally worded
statute actually constitutes “clear congressional
authorization” for a major power that otherwise falls within
the general terms?
For starters, and critically, the Court has repeatedly
emphasized that the major questions doctrine is not a
magic words requirement. In other words, the doctrine does
not require an explicit reference to the specific major power
itself. As the Court’s cases amply demonstrate, the major
questions doctrine does not “forc[e] Congress to delegate in
highly specific terms.” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 516
() (quotation marks omitted).
Rather than require magic words (such as the words
“tariff ” or “duty” here), the Court’s cases have focused on
four somewhat overlapping factors or considerations in
order to assess whether a generally worded statute
constitutes “clear congressional authorization” for the
specific major power.18
First, the major questions doctrine’s most prominent
work has been to ensure that the Executive cannot
suddenly seize on an old and generally worded statute to
exercise a power of great economic and political significance
when that power would not reasonably have been
understood at the time of enactment to fall within that
generally worded statute. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
720–735; Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–161. As
the Court has said: “When an agency claims to discover in
a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a
——————
18 Both JUSTICE GORSUCH and JUSTICE BARRETT have likewise read the
Court’s precedents to identify those same four factors, as they explained
in their incisive separate opinions in West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v.
Nebraska, respectively. See 597 U. S. 697, 746–749 (2022) (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring) (referring to the four “telling clues”); 600 U. S., at 517–520
(); see also ante, at 27 ().

significant portion of the American economy, we typically
greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism.”
Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324 (citation and quotation marks
omitted); West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 748 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring).
The doctrine thus precludes an agency’s attempt to
effectuate “a fundamental revision of the statute.” MCI
Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994). Stated otherwise,
an “agency’s attempt to deploy an old statute focused on one
problem to solve a new and different problem” may be “a
warning sign that it is acting without clear congressional
authority.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 747 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring). The Court’s skepticism about major executive
action in those scenarios has been heightened when
Congress has “conspicuously and repeatedly declined to
enact” legislation that would have authorized the executive
action in question. Id., at 724 (majority opinion).
A prototypical example occurred when OSHA, in order to
justify a nationwide COVID–19 vaccine mandate for
workers, relied “on a statutory provision that was adopted
40 years before the pandemic and that focused on
conditions specific to the workplace.” Id., at 747 (GORSUCH,
J., concurring). Another example arose when EPA invoked
“newfound authority to regulate” emissions from “millions
of small sources—including retail stores, offices, apartment
buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches.” Utility
Air, 573 U. S., at 328. Yet another happened when the CDC
tried to impose an eviction moratorium for rental housing
through an “unprecedented” assertion of its authority to
regulate public health. Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594
U. S., at 765.
Second, courts examine the “agency’s past
interpretations of the relevant statute.” West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 747 (). The Executive’s
“track record can be particularly probative” in the major

questions context. Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 519
().
A “contemporaneous and long-held Executive Branch
interpretation of a statute is entitled to some weight.” West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 747 ()
(quotation marks omitted). Just “as established practice
may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general
statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by
those who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is
equally significant in determining whether such power was
actually conferred.” Id., at 725 (majority opinion)
(quotation marks omitted).
The NFIB Court therefore found it critical that “OSHA,
in its half century of existence, has never before adopted a
broad public health regulation of this kind” under the
statute that the agency sought to invoke as authority for
the vaccine mandate. 595 U. S., at 119. Likewise, in Brown
& Williamson, the FDA had “repeatedly and consistently
assert[ed] that it lacks jurisdiction under the FDCA to
regulate tobacco products.” 529 U. S., at 156. And in West
Virginia, EPA had not “previously interpreted the relevant
provision to confer on it such vast authority” to transform
American industry. 597 U. S., at 749 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring).
Third, courts assess whether “there is a mismatch
between an agency’s challenged action and its
congressionally assigned mission and expertise,” id., at 748
()—in other words, whether an
agency is trying to regulate “outside its wheelhouse,” Biden
v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 518 ().
In the NFIB case, OSHA, which is empowered to “set
workplace safety standards, not broad public health
measures,” mandated COVID–19 vaccines. 595 U. S., at
117. In Alabama Assn. of Realtors, the CDC—a public
health agency—attempted to regulate housing. 594 U. S.,
at 763–765. In Gonzales v. Oregon, the Attorney General

sought to assert authority over the drugs used in physician-
assisted suicide. 546 U. S. 243, 267–268 (2006).
All of those cases involved serious mismatches between
the agency’s usual regulatory activities and its asserted
major power.
Fourth, the Court looks at whether the relevant statutory
language used to justify the Executive’s exercise of a major
power is “oblique,” “elliptical,” or “cryptic.” West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 746–747 ()
(alterations and quotation marks omitted). As the Court
has often said, Congress does not “hide elephants” in
statutory “mouseholes.” Whitman v. American Trucking
Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).
In MCI Telecommunications Corp., for example, the
Court refused to allow the FCC to eliminate rate regulation
and fundamentally overhaul the telecommunications
industry based on a “subtle” provision that merely
permitted the FCC to “modify” rate-filing requirements.
512 U. S., at 231 (quotation marks omitted). In Brown &
Williamson, the Court rejected the FDA’s attempt to
regulate the tobacco industry based on a “cryptic” statutory
provision that referred to “safety.” 529 U. S., at 160
(quotation marks omitted). In Gonzales, the Court said that
Congress would not have granted the Attorney General the
power to regulate physician-assisted suicide through
“oblique” statutory language. 546 U. S., at 267. And in
West Virginia, the Court found it unlikely that Congress
would have granted major power to reshape the energy
industry in a “previously little-used backwater” of the
statute. 597 U. S., at 730.
2
So in this case we must apply those four factors in order
to determine whether Congress, when it afforded the
President the power to “regulate . . . importation,” clearly
authorized the President to impose tariffs. As I see it, those

factors show that Congress clearly authorized tariffs in
IEEPA when it empowered the President to “regulate . . .
importation.”
First, unlike the OSHA vaccine mandate in NFIB or the
greenhouse gas regulation in Utility Air, for example, the
President here is not exercising an “unheralded” or
“newfound authority” based on a “long-extant” statute—
that is, exercising a power that was unanticipated or
unforeseen when Congress enacted IEEPA’s “regulate . . .
importation” language in 1977.
On the contrary, as was fully explained above, the tariff
authority exercised here is not remotely “unheralded.” To
recap: Any citizen or Member of Congress who paid the
least bit of attention in 1977 would have readily understood
that the President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation”
encompassed the power to tariff. There are the dictionary
definitions and the historical usage and practice. And
among other things, just a few years before IEEPA, that
“regulate . . . importation” language was invoked by
President Nixon and judicially approved to sustain his 10
percent worldwide tariffs. President Ford then
implemented significant tariffs using substantially similar
“adjust the imports” statutory language, and this Court
unanimously upheld President Ford’s tariffs in Algonquin.
So IEEPA’s grant of authority to the President to impose
tariffs in order to regulate importation is not “unheralded”
or “newfound.” That authority was plain as day in 1977.19
——————
19The Court downplays the significance of the prominent Nixon and
Ford tariffs. Ante, at 17–19 (majority opinion); ante, at 27–28, 39
(). But the Nixon and Ford examples, as well as
Algonquin, are critical for a proper and full understanding of the
meaning of “regulate . . . importation” when Congress enacted IEEPA in
1977. We cannot ignore or diminish that history. THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
opinion and JUSTICE GORSUCH’s concurrence also say that no President
since 1977 has invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs. Ante, at 10 (opinion of
ROBERTS, C. J.); ante, at 27–28 (). But since

Second, the President is not interpreting the “regulate . . .
importation” language in IEEPA differently from how past
Presidents have interpreted it. At least as far as the
briefing and arguments in this case have disclosed, no
Presidential Administration since the enactment of the
“regulate . . . importation” language in TWEA in 1941 or
since its re-enactment in IEEPA in 1977 has interpreted
the statute to exclude the power to impose tariffs.
Moreover, before IEEPA’s enactment, President Nixon
imposed tariffs based on the same “regulate . . .
importation” language. And in 1975, President Ford
invoked authority to “adjust the imports” in order to
similarly impose monetary exactions. In addition—if more
is needed—Marshall, Story, Madison, and this Court have
all long recognized that the power to regulate foreign
commerce includes tariffs.
The current President’s reading of IEEPA follows from
and is entirely consistent with those past interpretations—
making his position nothing like, for example, FDA’s when
it changed its longstanding position that it lacked the
authority to regulate cigarettes, Brown & Williamson, 529
U. S., at 159–160, or OSHA’s when it implemented a
vaccine requirement even though it had “never before
adopted a broad public health regulation of this kind,”
NFIB, 595 U. S., at 119.
When, as here, “established practice,” West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 725 (quotation marks omitted), and the Executive’s
“track record,” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 519
——————
1977, Presidents have imposed numerous tariffs under non-emergency
tariff statutes—including Section 232, which like IEEPA also does not
explicitly reference tariffs or taxes. The fact that recent Presidents have
not often had occasion under the National Emergencies Act to declare
national emergencies in which tariffs would help “deal with” the specific
emergency at issue does not mean that Presidents have now lost the
authority exercised by President Nixon to impose tariffs. IEEPA was not
designed as a use-it-or-lose-it source of emergency authority.

(), convincingly show that the
general statutory language has long been understood to
cover the specific power asserted by the Executive, that
record should all but resolve the matter for major questions
purposes.
Third, there is no mismatch: The power to tariff falls
squarely within the President’s wheelhouse. From the
Founding, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion today
acknowledges, numerous other statutes have afforded—
and still do afford—the President broad power to impose
tariffs. Ante, at 8–9. This case is entirely different,
therefore, from our prior major questions cases, where, for
example, the CDC attempted to impose an eviction
moratorium, Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594 U. S., at 763–
765; OSHA sought to implement a nationwide vaccine
mandate, NFIB, 595 U. S., at 117–120; the FDA tried to
regulate cigarettes, Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–
161; and the Attorney General attempted to regulate
physician-assisted suicide, Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 267–268.
Presidents imposing tariffs—whether pursuant to
inherent wartime authority, pursuant to TWEA and
IEEPA’s “regulate . . . importation” language, pursuant to
Section 232’s “adjust the imports” text, or pursuant to the
many other tariff statutory authorities—is hardly an
unusual occurrence in our Nation’s history or in recent
times. For example, Presidents George W. Bush, Obama,
and Biden all imposed tariffs pursuant to congressional
authorization. There is no mismatch between the tariff
power and the President’s “mission and expertise.” West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 748 ().
Fourth, the President is not relying on oblique, elliptical,
or cryptic language. This case does not involve “elephants
in mouseholes.” Whitman, 531 U. S., at 468. This case
instead involves an elephant (tariffs) in a statutory
elephant hole (the power to “regulate . . . importation” to
deal with foreign threats in national emergencies). IEEPA

was a major and thoroughly studied statute carefully
crafted to grant the President a suite of powerful tools,
including to “regulate . . . importation,” and thereby allow
him to respond swiftly to national emergencies and to help
America respond to crises. Since its enactment, Presidents
have invoked IEEPA more than 70 times to deal with
emergencies and threats from the September 11, 2001, al
Qaeda attacks to Iran to North Korea, and many others.
See Congressional Research Service, The International
Emergency Economic Powers Act: Origins, Evolution, and
Use 18–32 (2025).
By 1977, moreover, it was well-known that tariffs on
foreign imports—along with even more powerful tools such
as quotas and embargoes—were a common way to “regulate
. . . importation.” IEEPA thus bears zero resemblance to
the paradigmatic “previously little-used backwater”
statutory provision that cannot support significant
executive actions. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 730.
All of that makes this case dramatically different from—
really, the opposite of—the major questions cases where the
Court has ruled against the Government. The text, the
history, the context, and the precedent all point strongly to
the conclusion that as of 1977, tariffs were a well-
recognized means of regulating importation, like quotas
and embargoes.
As Judge Taranto persuasively summarized, this case
bears none of the hallmarks of past major questions cases
where the Court found a lack of clear congressional
authorization for the Government’s asserted major power.
IEEPA’s “facial breadth in an emergency context makes the
straightforward application of the statute’s words hardly
unheralded, and if a more specific herald is needed, it is
present in the [Nixon] 1971 proclamation, Yoshida CCPA,
and subsequent congressional adoption of the relevant
language in 1977.” 149 F. 4th 1312, 1376 (CA Fed. 2025)
(dissenting opinion) (citations omitted). IEEPA seeks “to

provide flexibility in the tools available to the President to
address the unusual and extraordinary threats specified in
a declared national emergency. This is not an ‘ancillary,’
‘little used backwater’ provision, or a delegation outside the
recipient’s wheelhouse.” Ibid. (citation omitted).
This Court’s recent decision in Biden v. Missouri, 595
U. S. 87 (2022) (per curiam), strongly supports the
President’s position here. That case involved a challenge to
President Biden’s COVID–19 vaccine requirement for
millions of healthcare workers. The executive action there,
too, was undoubtedly major. But the Court upheld the
Government’s vaccine mandate based on a general
statutory authorization for HHS to impose safety
requirements for healthcare facilities—notwithstanding
the lack of explicit statutory reference to vaccines. Id., at
90–96. In doing so, the Court emphasized that state
vaccination requirements were common for healthcare
workers and that the Federal Government regularly
required healthcare workers to take various safety
precautions. Id., at 94–95. Notably, the Court upheld the
vaccine mandate even though (as the dissenters pointed
out) the Federal Government had not traditionally imposed
such vaccine requirements on healthcare workers. See id.,
at 104 ().
The clarity of the congressional authorization in today’s
case is far stronger than in Biden v. Missouri. The Nixon
and Ford tariffs, the Algonquin decision, and the
President’s longstanding authority to regulate trade and
impose tariffs establish—much more comprehensively and
clearly than in Biden v. Missouri—that the President is not
claiming some “unheralded power” that represents a
“transformative expansion” of his authority. Utility Air,
573 U. S., at 324.
Because the Court upheld the Executive’s exercise of a
major power in Biden v. Missouri, it follows that the Court

today should likewise uphold the President’s assertion of a
major power here. Like cases should be treated alike.
In response to all of that, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion
clings to its primary argument in this case—that a statute
must use the word “tariff ” or “duty” or “tax” or the like to
authorize tariffs on foreign imports. But this Court has
repeatedly emphasized that the major questions doctrine is
not a magic words requirement. THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
opinion identifies no case that has demanded such
specificity. And in Algonquin, this Court unanimously and
squarely rejected the same argument that the statutory
provision must specifically mention “tariffs” or “duties” or
“taxes” for the President to impose tariffs on foreign
imports. Under THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion, the Nixon
and Ford tariffs would also have been unlawful. So too
might other tariffs imposed under the longstanding Section
232 tariff statute, which broadly authorizes the President
to “adjust the imports” of a foreign good without mentioning
“tariffs” or “taxes.” And so would tariffs imposed in
wartime under TWEA’s authority to “regulate . . .
importation.”20
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion’s approach to the major
questions doctrine is a magic-words test under another
name—in contravention of our precedents that make clear
that Congress need not use magic words or “highly specific”
——————
20Under the Court’s decision today, the President’s authority to impose
tariffs under TWEA during wartime is presumably now gone given that
TWEA has the same “regulate . . . importation” language, 50 U. S. C.
§4305(b)(1)(B)—unless the Court thinks that the statutory text somehow
means one thing in TWEA and another in IEEPA, which would be
historically inaccurate and textually unsupportable. One might think
that the Court’s opinion would also mean that tariffs cannot be imposed
under Section 232, which authorizes the President to “adjust the
imports.” After all, that statutory provision likewise does not refer to
“tariffs,” duties,” “taxes,” “fees,” or the like. But in Algonquin, the Court
read Section 232 to authorize tariffs. I assume that the Court today does
not intend to overrule Algonquin.

terms. Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 516 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring) (quotation marks omitted).21
In previous cases, the Court has looked at the four factors
to determine whether there is “clear congressional
authorization” precisely because the major questions canon
has no magic words requirement. If magic words or the
equivalent were necessary, that would be the only factor.
And the Court would not need the four factors that the
Court has consistently applied.22
In sum, under the major questions doctrine as the Court
has applied it, this should be a straightforward case.
Congress supplied clear authorization for the President to
impose tariffs under IEEPA.
B

Second, there is an alternative and independent reason
why the major questions doctrine does not apply here: This
is a foreign affairs case.
A plethora of statutes in the U. S. Code grant the
Executive the power to act in foreign affairs. And most of
the important actions that “presidents take today,
including in foreign affairs, rest at least in part on statutory
——————
21Taken at face value, moreover, the Court’s major questions analysis
would presumably also preclude Presidents from imposing quotas under
IEEPA. Quotas are justified under the same “regulate . . . importation”
language. How could the Court distinguish quotas from tariffs for major
questions purposes? After all, quotas can be of even greater economic
and political significance than tariffs.
22 In his concurrence, JUSTICE GORSUCH opines that the phrase
“monetary exactions on foreign imports” would constitute clear
congressional authorization, but that the phrase “regulate . . .
importation” does not. Ante, at 30. But if the phrase “regulate . . .
importation” has historically and commonly encompassed “monetary
exactions on foreign imports”—as it has—and if the four major questions
factors taken together support the Executive—as they do—then I cannot
agree with the line that JUSTICE GORSUCH is drawing between those two
formulations.

authorization.” C. Bradley & J. Goldsmith, Foreign Affairs,
Nondelegation, and the Major Questions Doctrine, 172 U.
Pa. L. Rev. 1743, 1745 (2024).
Yet this Court has never before applied the major
questions doctrine—or anything resembling it—to a foreign
affairs statute. I would not make this case the first.
Rather, in the foreign affairs context, this Court has
interpreted statutes as written, with respect for the
primacy of Congress’s and the President’s roles in foreign
affairs and without using the major questions doctrine as a
thumb on the scale against the President. See, e.g.,
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 529–530 (1988).
That deeply rooted textualist approach to interpreting
foreign affairs statutes is nothing new. What is new and
rather extraordinary is the approach embodied in THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion for three Justices, which would
extend the major questions doctrine into the foreign affairs
realm for the first time.
Recall that the major questions doctrine is based on two
overlapping foundations: “separation of powers principles
and a practical understanding of legislative intent.” West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723.
With respect to separation of powers, the major questions
doctrine serves to reinforce the nondelegation doctrine. But
in the foreign affairs realm, the Court has recognized that
Congress often broadly delegates authority to the
Executive. From the Founding, numerous foreign affairs
statutes “authorizing action by the President in respect of
subjects affecting foreign relations” either “leave the
exercise of the power to his unrestricted judgment, or
provide a standard far more general than that which has
always been considered requisite with regard to domestic
affairs.” United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299
U. S. 304, 324 (1936); Department of Transportation v.
Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S. 43, 80, n. 5
(2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). The reason

for those broad delegations is simple and obvious: If
“success” for America’s foreign affairs “aims” is to be
“achieved, congressional legislation . . . must often accord to
the President a degree of discretion and freedom from
statutory restriction which would not be admissible were
domestic affairs alone involved.” Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S.,
at 320. Stated otherwise, “Congress—in giving the
Executive authority over matters of foreign affairs—must
of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it
customarily wields in domestic areas.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U. S. 1, 17 (1965).
As Justice Robert Jackson summarized, the Court’s
nondelegation cases—consistent with the “unbroken
legislative practice which has prevailed almost from the
inception of the national government,” Curtiss-Wright, 299
U. S., at 322—have “recognized internal and external
affairs as being in separate categories, and held that the
strict limitation upon congressional delegations of power to
the President over internal affairs does not apply with
respect to delegations of power in external affairs.”
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636,
n. 2 (1952) (concurring opinion); see Curtiss-Wright, 299
U. S., at 319–322; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S.
388, 422 (1935).
As Justice Jackson further noted, the Court’s precedents
recognize the “‘unwisdom of requiring Congress in this field
of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite
standards by which the President is to be governed.’”
Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 636, n. 2 (concurring opinion)
(quoting Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 321–322).
If the major questions doctrine is designed in part to
protect nondelegation principles, but the nondelegation
doctrine does not play a substantial role in foreign affairs
cases (as the Court has held), then it follows that courts
should not employ the major questions doctrine to put a
thumb on the scale against the President when interpreting

foreign affairs statutes. Rather, as Justice Robert Jackson
stated, courts should interpret those statutes as written.
Relatedly, to the extent that the major questions doctrine
is designed to reflect a “practical understanding of
legislative intent,” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723, the
doctrine appropriately plays no role in “national security or
foreign policy contexts, because the canon does not reflect
ordinary congressional intent in those areas.” FCC v.
Consumers’ Research, 606 U. S. 656, 706 (2025)
(KAVANAUGH, J., concurring). In the foreign affairs realm,
Congress “has good reason to—and intends to—authorize
many executive branch actions related to foreign affairs in
broad or general terms.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa.
L. Rev., at 1793.
Congress ordinarily seeks “to give the President
substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and
the American people.” Consumers’ Research, 606 U. S., at
706–707 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring). After all, the
President exercises the “vast share of responsibility for the
conduct of our foreign relations.” American Ins. Assn. v.
Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414 (2003) (quotation marks
omitted). So Congress “often” gives the President “a degree
of discretion.” Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 320. That
“unbroken legislative practice” from the Founding means
that courts interpreting statutes in the foreign affairs field
should assume that Congress meant what it said. Id., at
322.
Stated otherwise, “if the major questions doctrine turns
on a contextual inquiry into likely congressional intent, it
is likely for a variety of reasons to have less purchase in the
foreign affairs area.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa. L.
Rev., at 1790.
To be clear, Congress of course maintains the ultimate
power over how broadly or narrowly to write statutes in the
foreign policy and national security contexts. For example,
Congress can write foreign affairs statutes narrowly.

Indeed, even for wartime powers, Congress rarely gives the
President a “blank check.” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.
507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion). And when Congress
writes a narrow foreign affairs statute, this Court has
enforced those statutory limits as written. Cf. Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 593–595 (2006); id., at 638–639
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part).
Moreover, when it does legislate more broadly, Congress
sometimes claws back the statutory authorization by
rescinding or amending overbroad statutes, or by
restricting previously granted Presidential power through
the leverage it possesses over appropriations, new
legislation, or confirmations. See, e.g., Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 1783; Military
Commissions Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 2600, as amended, 10
U. S. C. §948a et seq.; Case-Church Amendment, Pub. L.
93–50, §307, 87 Stat. 129. Either House of Congress alone,
through the appropriations process, can insist on certain
limits as a condition of approving funding. At the end of the
day, given the appropriations power, Congress holds the
cards.
In short, in the foreign affairs context, this Court has
never before super-imposed the major questions doctrine (or
any similar canon or principle) onto ordinary statutory
interpretation to place a thumb on the scale against the
President. Rather, the Court interprets the relevant
statutes according to their text, with respect for Congress’s
and the President’s central roles in the foreign policy and
national security fields.
2
This tariffs case plainly falls into the foreign affairs
category. IEEPA “directly and expressly relate[s] to foreign
affairs.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 1796.
And like quotas and embargoes, tariffs regulate the goods

that are imported into the country from foreign nations.
The tariffs do not apply to goods produced in America.
Moreover, tariffs on foreign imports are significant tools
of foreign policy and national security, whether imposed
under IEEPA, TWEA, Section 232, Section 122, Section
201, Section 301, or Section 338. They are often used to
“advance foreign policy goals, or as negotiating leverage in
trade negotiations.” Congressional Research Service, U. S.
Tariff Policy: Overview 1 (2025). Like other economic tools,
tariffs can “serve as a ‘bargaining chip’ to be used by the
President when dealing with a hostile country,” Dames &
Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 673 (1981)—or to incentivize
a change in behavior by allies, partners, or enemies. Cf.
Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 80 (opinion
of THOMAS, J.) (embargo statute “involved the external
relations of the United States”); Gundy v. United States,
588 U. S. 128, 170–171 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting).
With respect to foreign trade specifically, Congress often
“invest[s] the President with large discretion in matters
arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and
commerce with other nations.” Marshall Field & Co. v.
Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 691 (1892). Since the Founding, that
longstanding practice has included tariff statutes:
Congress has granted the President expansive power over
tariffs and foreign trade. Ante, at 13–17 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting). And this Court has uniformly rejected
challenges to tariffs imposed by Presidents under those
statutory authorities. E.g., Federal Energy Administration
v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548, 558–560 (1976); J.
W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409
(1928); Marshall Field, 143 U. S., at 690–694; Cargo of Brig
Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382, 386–388 (1813).
As Professors Bradley and Goldsmith well summarized,
there is a “settled practice of about a century of the
executive branch exercising emergency powers in many
important contexts pursuant to the broadly worded IEEPA

and its predecessor, the Trading with the Enemy Act. And
there is an even longer practice, dating to the Founding, of
presidents exercising trade-related sanctions authority
pursuant to broadly worded statutes. Notably, the Court
has already suggested in both of these contexts that one
should expect Congress to, in effect, paint with a broad
brush.” 172 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 1796–1797.
As with tariffs on foreign imports historically, the IEEPA
tariffs on foreign imports at issue in this case implicate
foreign affairs. According to the Government, the President
has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into trade deals with major
trading partners including China, the United Kingdom, and
Japan, among other countries. The Government says that
the tariffs have helped make certain foreign markets more
accessible to American businesses and have contributed to
trade deals with foreign nations worth trillions of dollars.
Moreover, consistent with history and the traditional
uses of tariffs, the President “is exercising his IEEPA
authority in connection with highly sensitive negotiations
he is conducting to end the conflict between the Russian
Federation and Ukraine.” Decl. of M. Rubio in No. 25–1812
(CA Fed., Aug. 29, 2025), p. 3. To that end, on August 6,
2025, the President imposed tariffs on India for “directly or
indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.” Exec. Order
No. 14329, 90 Fed. Reg. 38701 (2025). And on February 6,
2026, the President reduced the tariffs on India because,
according to the Government, India had “committed to stop
directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.”
Exec. Order No. 14384, 91 Fed. Reg. 6501 (2026).
To be sure, most foreign affairs and national security
actions—whether war, international agreements, trade
deals, or tariffs—lead to significant domestic ramifications
within the United States. And this case is no exception.
Nonetheless, in the foreign affairs field, courts interpret
statutes as written, with appropriate respect to Congress
and the President and without a major questions doctrine

weight on the scale against the President. See Youngstown,
343 U. S., at 636, n. 2 (Jackson, J., concurring).
Lest there be any remaining doubt that the major
questions doctrine does not apply to tariffs on foreign
imports, recall again this Court’s decision in Algonquin.
That case involved significant tariffs imposed by President
Ford on oil imports. The relevant statute granted the
President the authority to “adjust the imports.” 19 U. S. C.
§1862(b) (1970 ed.). The Court upheld the tariffs by
interpreting the statute as written. Neither the major
questions doctrine—nor anything resembling that
doctrine—played a role in that case.
In short, “Presidential actions pursuant to broad
congressional authorizations related to foreign affairs often
have long historical pedigrees that can in various ways
inform congressional intent to approve the actions in
question. To the extent that this is so in particular
instances, the major questions doctrine’s clear authorization
requirement does not apply.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U.
Pa. L. Rev., at 1794 (emphasis added).
So it is here: Presidents “have long been granted
substantial discretion over tariffs.” Id., at 1759, n. 90. This
Court has never before applied the major questions doctrine
to a statute authorizing the President to take action with
respect to foreign affairs in general or tariffs in particular.
And it should not do so today.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion’s reliance on the major
questions doctrine in this foreign affairs case is a first—a
novel and unprecedented use of the major questions
doctrine to invalidate Presidential action taken pursuant to
congressional authorization in the foreign affairs area. I
firmly disagree with that use of the major questions
doctrine here. In the foreign affairs context, including
tariffs, the longstanding rule is simple: Interpret the

statute as written, not with a thumb on the scale against
the President.23
3
Related precedent further demonstrates that the major
questions doctrine has not traditionally applied in the
national security or foreign policy contexts. Consider two
prominent examples.
First, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, this Court
considered the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military
Force, which Congress passed and President George W.
Bush signed on September 18, 2001, in the wake of the al
Qaeda attacks on the United States. The law broadly
——————
23 In his thoughtful concurrence, JUSTICE GORSUCH agrees that the
major questions doctrine often does not apply to foreign affairs statutes,
but in his view it does not apply only when the President also has
inherent or independent Article II power. Ante, at 30–31. THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s opinion for three Justices also gestures at that position. See
ante, at 12–13. I see some analytical and practical problems with that
approach.
First, as JUSTICE GORSUCH elsewhere notes, the major questions
doctrine serves in part to reinforce nondelegation principles. Yet as I
have explained, the Court’s nondelegation cases from the Founding to
the present—including numerous cases involving tariffs—have
“recognized internal and external affairs as being in separate categories,
and held that the strict limitation upon congressional delegations of
power to the President over internal affairs does not apply with respect
to delegations of power in external affairs.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636, n. 2 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring);
see also United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304,
319–322 (1936); Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 422 (1935).
In those cases, the Court has not further subdivided the foreign affairs
power in the manner that JUSTICE GORSUCH now suggests.
Second, terms such as “inherent” or “independent” in this context
continue to be “used, often interchangeably and without fixed or
ascertainable meanings.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 647 (Jackson, J.,
concurring); see also id., at 637. So it would be both novel and
jurisprudentially chaotic to try to now create a new approach tying the
applicability of the major questions canon in the foreign affairs context
to such uncertain triggers.

empowered the President to use “all necessary and
appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or
persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or
aided the terrorist attacks” that occurred on September 11,
2001. Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115 Stat. 224
(Sept. 18, 2001).
In Hamdi, the Government militarily detained in the
United States an American citizen who had taken up arms
with the Taliban. 542 U. S., at 510–511. The plaintiff
Hamdi argued, among other things, that the AUMF
generally authorized the use of force but did not specifically
authorize military detention, at least detention of
American-citizen enemy combatants in the United States.
See id., at 515–517. He contended that his military
detention was therefore illegal.
In the principal opinion by Justice O’Connor, the Court
rejected Hamdi’s statutory argument, explaining that it
was “of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific
language of detention.” Id., at 519. Rather, because
“detention to prevent a combatant’s return to the battlefield
is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the
use of ‘necessary and appropriate force,’ Congress has
clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the
narrow circumstances considered here.” Ibid.
Consider the similarities between Hamdi and this case.
Both involve major questions of foreign affairs. Hamdi
involved U. S. military detention of an American citizen in
America, pursuant to a generally worded authorization for
use of military force. This case involves tariffs on foreign
goods imported into America pursuant to a generally
worded authorization to regulate importation. Detention is
a traditional incident of the President’s delegated power to
wage war. See id., at 518. Tariffs are a traditional incident
of the President’s delegated power to regulate imports and
foreign commerce. In Hamdi, the Court said that as a
matter of history, practice, and precedent, the AUMF’s

general authorization for the use of military force clearly
encompassed detention of enemy combatants. Id., at 518–
522. Here, as a matter of history, practice, and precedent,
IEEPA’s general authorization for regulation of
importation likewise clearly encompasses tariffs on foreign
imports.
Second, in 1981 in Dames & Moore, 453 U. S. 654, the
Court did not apply the major questions doctrine, even
though the Court had recently applied that principle in a
significant domestic policy case. Cf. Industrial Union Dept.,
AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607
(1980) (plurality opinion).
The Dames & Moore case arose in the wake of the Iran
hostage crisis where Iran held more than 50 American
hostages at the U. S. Embassy in Iran for more than 14
months. As one part of the ultimate settlement of the
hostage crisis with Iran, President Reagan suspended
claims by U. S. nationals against Iran that were pending in
American courts. Dames & Moore, 453 U. S., at 666. The
President did so under IEEPA and the Hostage Act. Id., at
675.
There can be little doubt that the question of suspending
American citizens’ claims against Iran was one of major
economic and political significance. And the Court further
recognized that the case touched “fundamentally upon the
manner in which our Republic is to be governed.” Id., at
659. Yet the Court did not require “clear congressional
authorization” for the President’s exercise of that authority
to suspend the Americans’ claims against Iran.
On the contrary, the Court openly acknowledged that the
relevant statutes—IEEPA and the Hostage Act—did not
provide clear or “specific authorization” for the President to
suspend those claims. Id., at 677. The Court nonetheless
concluded that the “general tenor of Congress’ legislation in
this area”—combined with Congress’s longstanding
acquiescence to the President’s practice of settling claims—

supported the President’s suspension of those claims. Id.,
at 678. Congress’s “general tenor” and acquiescence are of
course far less than the “clear congressional authorization”
that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion today newly demands for
the President’s tariffs.
Again, consider the similarities between Dames & Moore
and this case. Dames & Moore involved complicated
questions of foreign policy and national security. The
statutes in Dames & Moore were generally worded and did
not specifically authorize suspension of claims. But
Presidents had historically exercised a similar power. See
id., at 677–682. Here, we likewise have a generally worded
statutory authorization to “regulate . . . importation.” And
Presidents have historically imposed tariffs.
If IEEPA permitted the President to lawfully suspend
claims in Dames & Moore—despite the Court’s transparent
acknowledgment that the actual statutory text did not
clearly authorize the President’s actions—then surely
IEEPA’s authorization to “regulate . . . importation” easily
justifies these tariffs.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion would chart a new course
for the major questions doctrine, extending it for the first
time deep into the foreign affairs sphere. If the Court had
applied the major questions doctrine in Hamdi and Dames
& Moore, those two landmark cases almost certainly would
have been decided differently. So today’s opinion marks a
significant change. Will the Court apply the major
questions doctrine in the foreign affairs context again in the
future? Or is this a ticket good for one day and one train
only? Time will tell. But in the meantime, the decision
could engender significant uncertainty over the Executive’s
exercise of statutory authority in the foreign affairs realm.
As the Hamdi and Dames & Moore examples
demonstrate, applying the major questions doctrine in the
foreign policy and national security contexts in the past
would have seriously hindered the President’s ability to

exercise power granted by Congress to achieve important
foreign policy and national security objectives for America.
And if applied in the foreign affairs context in the future, it
could impair Presidents’ vital statutory authorities with
respect to foreign policy and national security.24
* * *
Having said all of that on foreign affairs, I reiterate that
the major questions doctrine—even if it applies in this
foreign affairs context—does not defeat major executive
actions that are clearly authorized by Congress. See
Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 1790–1791.
And as explained in Part III–A above, in IEEPA Congress
clearly authorized the President to impose tariffs to
“regulate . . . importation” in national emergencies. In
other words, even if the major questions doctrine applies in
the foreign affairs context exactly as it does in domestic
affairs, the President should still prevail in this case.
IV
Finally, no Member of the Court today relies on the
nondelegation doctrine. But the plaintiffs briefly raise such
an argument, and I will therefore briefly address it. The
——————
24What is the status going forward of the major questions doctrine in
foreign affairs cases? Only three Justices (at most) today suggest that
the major questions doctrine should apply in the foreign affairs context—
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE GORSUCH, and JUSTICE BARRETT. I doubt
that the major questions doctrine analysis in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
opinion for those three Justices is controlling for future cases as a matter
of precedent under the Marks rule. See Marks v. United States, 430 U. S.
188, 193 (1977). That is because three Justices (JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR,
JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE JACKSON) do not recognize the major
questions doctrine at all. Ante, at 1–2 (KAGAN, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). And this dissent would not apply it in the
foreign affairs context. So it appears that six Justices would not apply it
in the foreign affairs context. In my view, the question of whether or how
the major questions doctrine applies in foreign affairs cases remains at
least an open question.

argument is unavailing for many of the reasons already
noted in the major questions analysis above. This Court
has repeatedly rejected constitutional challenges to
congressional delegations to the President in the foreign
affairs area, including delegations of tariff authority.
For matters of foreign affairs and national security, the
Court has traditionally recognized that Congress “must of
necessity paint with a brush broader than that it
customarily wields in domestic areas.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U. S. 1, 17 (1965). And to reiterate, numerous statutes
“‘authorizing action by the President in respect of subjects
affecting foreign relations’” “‘either leave the exercise of the
power to his unrestricted judgment, or provide a standard
far more general than that which has always been
considered requisite with regard to domestic affairs.’”
Department of Transportation v. Association of American
Railroads, 575 U. S. 43, 80, n. 5 (2015) (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in judgment) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-
Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 324 (1936)). Therefore,
as JUSTICE THOMAS has explained, the Court’s precedents
establish that “the Constitution grants the President a
greater measure of discretion in the realm of foreign
relations.” Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at
80, n. 5; see Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at 319–
322; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 422
(1935).
Justice Robert Jackson likewise noted the “‘unwisdom of
requiring Congress in this field of governmental power to
lay down narrowly definite standards by which the
President is to be governed.’” Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636, n. 2 (1952) (concurring
opinion) (quoting Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 321–322).
As such, the “strict limitation upon congressional
delegations of power to the President over internal affairs
does not apply with respect to delegations of power in

external affairs.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 636, n. 2
(concurring opinion).
Because statutes that “involv[e] the external relations of
the United States” do not trigger the same kind of
delegation concerns as purely domestic ones, Association of
American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 80 (opinion of THOMAS,
J.), the Court has regularly upheld delegations of power to
the President in the national security and foreign policy
realms. See, e.g., Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 319–322;
Loving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 771–774 (1996).
Indeed, if a strict nondelegation doctrine applied in those
areas, numerous statutes—including many authorizations
for use of military force in the Nation’s history—would have
been unconstitutional delegations of authority to the
President. See Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115
Stat. 224 (Sept. 18, 2001) (“[T]he President is authorized to
use all necessary and appropriate force against those
nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned,
authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11, 2001”).
As to tariffs in particular: Broad delegations of tariff
authority to the President have been in the heartland of
permissible delegations upheld by this Court. Congress
may, without running afoul of the Constitution, “invest the
President with large discretion in matters arising out of the
execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with
other nations.” Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S.
649, 691 (1892). Congressional delegations of tariffs and
other foreign trade authorities to the President date back
to near the Founding. And this Court has uniformly
rejected nondelegation challenges to statutes delegating
that authority to the President. E.g., Federal Energy
Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548, 558–
560 (1976); J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276
U. S. 394, 409 (1928); Marshall Field, 143 U. S., at 690–694;

Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382, 386–
388 (1813).
This Court’s decision in Algonquin is again instructive.
There, the Court held that Section 232 did not constitute an
unconstitutional delegation. 426 U. S., at 558–560. The
Court found it sufficient that the President could act “only”
to the extent “he deems necessary to adjust the imports” of
an article such that it “will not threaten to impair the
national security.” Id., at 559 (quotation marks omitted).
To be clear, I am not suggesting that there is no
nondelegation doctrine in the foreign affairs realm. But the
Court has consistently recognized that the doctrine affords
more flexibility to Congress and the President in that area
to deal with the complex foreign relations issues and
national security threats facing America. See Association
of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 80, n. 5 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.); Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 636, n. 2 (Jackson,
J., concurring); Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 319–322;
Panama Refining, 293 U. S., at 422.
In all events, for purposes of this Court’s nondelegation
precedents, IEEPA sufficiently constrains the President’s
authority to declare an emergency and impose tariffs. See
J. W. Hampton, 276 U. S., at 409; FCC v. Consumers’
Research, 606 U. S. 656, 673–675, 681–691 (2025). The
President may exercise the authorities in IEEPA “only” “to
deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat” that “has
its source in whole or substantial part outside the United
States” and “with respect to which a national emergency
has been declared.” 50 U. S. C. §1701. Congress placed
numerous limits on IEEPA, including a default 1-year time
limit, an enumerated list of exceptions, and comprehensive
congressional reporting requirements. See §§1622(d),
1702(b), 1703.
It is also useful to underscore the extraordinary nature of
the plaintiffs’ nondelegation argument here. The plaintiffs’
submission would mean that these tariffs would be

unlawful even if IEEPA explicitly authorized tariffs. Unlike
their statutory and major questions doctrine arguments,
their nondelegation argument is not based on a lack of an
explicit reference to “tariffs” or “duties” or the like. Their
nondelegation argument instead goes much further and
would require very specific congressional directions to the
President on when and under what circumstances he could
impose tariffs and how high those tariffs could be. The
plaintiffs’ theory would have dramatic consequences and
likely wipe out many of the existing tariff statutes that have
long been upheld by this Court, as well as TWEA. And if
the tariff authority here is unlawful, so too are most if not
all IEEPA authorities such as asset freezes, embargoes, and
quotas. And it would not stop there. The plaintiffs’
nondelegation theory would threaten various other
national security and foreign affairs statutes that similarly
grant substantial discretion to the President. The Court
today thankfully does not go down that road.25
V
The overarching theme of the Court’s opinion is that
tariffs are not a clear means to “regulate . . . importation”
and that Congress was therefore required to use the word
“tariff,” “duty,” or the like in IEEPA in 1977 if it wanted to
authorize tariffs on foreign imports. But that conclusion
——————
25Some last points for completeness: The plaintiffs also raise two other
arguments that the Court today does not address or rely on. First, they
argue that Section 122, a non-emergency tariff statute that addresses
trade deficits, implicitly displaces IEEPA’s tariff authority. Second, they
argue that the tariffs here do not deal with an “unusual and
extraordinary threat” as to which a national emergency has been
declared. In my view, those arguments are insubstantial, as Judge
Taranto persuasively explained in the Federal Circuit. See 149 F. 4th
1312, 1359–1361, 1371–1375 (2025) (dissenting opinion). Because the
Court today does not address or rely on them, I will not discuss them
further here. Finally, I agree with footnote 1 of the Court’s opinion
regarding jurisdiction. Ante, at 5, n. 1.

contravenes text, history, and precedent. To summarize:
Algonquin in 1976 unanimously held the opposite. The
Nixon and Ford tariffs were based on statutory provisions
that did not use the word “tariff ” or “duty.” There is a long
tradition of Presidents imposing tariffs as a means of
regulating importation and commerce. The predecessor
Trading with the Enemy Act has long been understood to
authorize tariffs during wartime as a means to “regulate . . .
importation,” even though it does not use the word “tariff ”
or “duty.” The history of the Polk, Lincoln, and McKinley
tariffs shows that tariffs are a means of regulating
importation. Marshall, Story, and Madison stated that
tariffs are a means of regulating foreign commerce. The
dictionary definitions and ordinary usage establish that
tariffs are a means of regulating importation.
All of that and much more, in my view, overwhelmingly
establish that IEEPA clearly authorizes the President to
impose tariffs.
That said, with respect to tariffs in particular, the Court’s
decision might not prevent Presidents from imposing most
if not all of these same sorts of tariffs under other statutory
authorities. For example, Section 122 of the Trade Act of
1974 permits the President to impose a “temporary import
surcharge” to “deal with large and serious United States
balance-of-payments deficits.” 19 U. S. C. §2132(a).
Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides that, if the
International Trade Commission determines an article is
being imported in such quantities that it is “a substantial
cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the
domestic industry producing an article like or directly
competitive with the imported article,” the President may
take “appropriate and feasible action,” including imposing
a “duty.” §§2251(a), 2253(a)(3)(A). Section 301 of the Trade
Act of 1974 authorizes the President through a subordinate
officer to “impose duties” if he determines that “an act,
policy, or practice of a foreign country” is “unjustifiable and

burdens or restricts United States commerce.” §§2411(a)–
(c). Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 permits the
President to impose tariffs when he finds that “any foreign
country places any burden or disadvantage upon the
commerce of the United States.” §1338(d). And Section 232
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorizes the
President to, after receiving a report from the Secretary of
Commerce, “adjust the imports of [an] article and its
derivatives so that such imports will not threaten to impair
the national security.” §1862(c)(1)(a).
So the Court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict
Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court’s
decision is likely to generate other serious practical
consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds.
Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant
consequences for the U. S. Treasury. The Court says
nothing today about whether, and if so how, the
Government should go about returning the billions of
dollars that it has collected from importers. But that
process is likely to be a “mess,” as was acknowledged at oral
argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 153–155. A second issue is the
decision’s effect on the current trade deals. Because IEEPA
tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of
dollars—including with foreign nations from China to the
United Kingdom to Japan, the Court’s decision could
generate uncertainty regarding various trade agreements.
That process, too, could be difficult.

The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy.
But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are
clearly lawful. I respectfully dissent.
