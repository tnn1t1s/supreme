V.O.S. SELECTIONS, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE GORSUCH, concurring.
The President claims that Congress delegated to him an
extraordinary power in the International Emergency Eco-
nomic Powers Act (IEEPA)—the power to impose tariffs on
practically any products he wants, from any countries he
chooses, in any amounts he selects. Applying the major
questions doctrine, the principal opinion rejects that argu-
ment. I join in full. The Constitution lodges the Nation’s
lawmaking powers in Congress alone, and the major ques-
tions doctrine safeguards that assignment against execu-
tive encroachment. Under the doctrine’s terms, the Presi-
dent must identify clear statutory authority for the
extraordinary delegated power he claims. And, as the prin-
cipal opinion explains, that is a standard he cannot meet.

Whatever else might be said about Congress’s work in
IEEPA, it did not clearly surrender to the President the
sweeping tariff power he seeks to wield.
Not everyone sees it this way. Past critics of the major
questions doctrine do not object to its application in this
case, and they even join much of today’s principal opinion.
But, they insist, they can reach the same result by employ-
ing only routine tools of statutory interpretation. Post, at 1
(KAGAN, J., joined by SOTOMAYOR and JACKSON, JJ., con-
curring in part and concurring in judgment). Meanwhile,
one colleague who joins the principal opinion in full sug-
gests the major questions doctrine is nothing more than
routine statutory interpretation. Post, at 1 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring). Still others who have joined major questions
decisions in the past dissent from today’s application of the
doctrine. Post, at 1 (KAVANAUGH, J., joined by THOMAS and
ALITO, JJ., dissenting). Finally, seeking to sidestep the ma-
jor questions doctrine altogether, one colleague submits
that Congress may hand over to the President most of its
powers, including the tariff power, without limit. Post, at
1–2 (). It is an interesting turn of
events. Each camp warrants a visit.
I
Start with the critics. In the past, they have criticized
the major questions doctrine for two main reasons. The doc-
trine, they have suggested, is a novelty without basis in
law. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 779 (2022)
(KAGAN, J., joined by, inter alios, SOTOMAYOR, J., dissent-
ing) (calling the doctrine a “special cano[n]” that has “mag-
ically appear[ed]”). And, they have argued, the doctrine is
rooted in an “anti-administrative-state stance” that pre-
vents Congress from employing executive agency officials to
“d[o] important work.” Id., at 780. Today, the critics pro-
ceed differently. They join a section of the principal opinion
that applies the major questions doctrine. Ante, at 14–20.

And rather than critique the doctrine, they say only that it
is “unnecessary” in this case “because ordinary principles of
statutory interpretation lead to the same result.” Post, at
2–3 (opinion of KAGAN, J.).
A
Unpack that last claim first. My concurring colleagues
contend that, as a matter of “straight-up statutory construc-
tion,” IEEPA does not grant the President the power to im-
pose tariffs. Post, at 7. In doing so, they make thoughtful
points about the statute’s text and context. But their ap-
proach today is difficult to square with how they have in-
terpreted other statutes. Dissenting in past major ques-
tions cases, they have argued that broad statutory language
granting powers to executive officials should be read for all
it is worth. Yet, now, when it comes to IEEPA’s similarly
broad language granting powers to the President, they take
a more constrained approach.
Consider some examples of how they have proceeded in
the past. Dissenting in National Federation of Independent
Business v. OSHA, 595 U. S. 109 (2022) (per curiam)
(NFIB), two of my concurring colleagues confronted a stat-
ute charging the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-
istration with promoting “safe and healthful working con-
ditions.” Id., at 127, 132 (joint opinion of Breyer,
SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ.) (internal quotation marks
omitted). They read that language as authorizing the
agency to impose a vaccine mandate on 84 million Ameri-
cans. Id., at 132; id., at 120 (per curiam). In support of
their reading, my colleagues stressed the statute’s “expan-
sive language,” another provision authorizing the agency to
issue temporary “emergency standards,” and “the scope of
the crisis” the agency was trying to address. Id., at 132, 135
(joint dissent) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Dissenting in Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of
Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. 758 (2021)

(per curiam), my colleagues addressed a statute permitting
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue reg-
ulations “necessary to prevent the . . . transmission . . . of
communicable diseases.” Id., at 768 (opinion of Breyer, J.,
joined by SOTOMAYOR and KAGAN, JJ.) (internal quotation
marks omitted). As they saw it, those terms granted the
agency the power to regulate landlord-tenant relations na-
tionwide during COVID–19. Ibid. In reaching this conclu-
sion, my colleagues again highlighted the statute’s “broad”
language and suggested that it permitted the agency to im-
pose even “greater restrictions” than the ones at issue in the
case. Id., at 769.
Dissenting in West Virginia, my colleagues faced a stat-
ute allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to en-
sure power plants employ the “best system of emission re-
duction.” 597 U. S., at 758 (opinion of KAGAN, J.) (internal
quotation marks omitted). They read that provision as au-
thorizing the agency to effectively close many power plants
and transform the electricity industry from coast to coast.
See id., at 754–755. In support, they once more argued that
the statutory language was “broad” and “expansive,” with
“no ifs, ands, or buts.” Id., at 756–758. They stressed, too,
that the relevant statutory terms appeared in “major legis-
lation” intended to address “big problems,” and that the
statute authorized actions in the agency’s “traditional lane”
or “wheelhouse.” Id., at 756–757, 765.
Finally, dissenting in Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477
(2023), my colleagues took up a statute permitting the Sec-
retary of Education to “waive or modify any statutory or
regulatory provision applying to [a federal] student-loan
program” during a national emergency. Id., at 533 (opinion
of KAGAN, J., joined by SOTOMAYOR and JACKSON, JJ.) (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted). They said that language
allowed the Secretary to cancel $430 billion in federal stu-
dent-loan debt because of COVID–19. See ibid.; id., at 501
(majority opinion). Once again, they argued that the

statutory terms were “broad,” “expansive,” “capacious,” and
designed to afford the Secretary a “poten[t]” power to re-
spond to “national emergencies” that were “major in scope.”
Id., at 533–542 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Now compare all that to how my colleagues proceed here.
This case, they say, is “nearly the opposite.” Post, at 3.
While straight-up statutory interpretation granted execu-
tive officials all the power they sought in all those other
cases, my colleagues insist this one is different because
IEEPA simply does not “give the President the power he
wants.” Ibid.
That’s a striking turn given the statutory terms before
us. When the President declares a national emergency “to
deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat . . . to the
national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United
States,” 50 U. S. C. §1701(a), IEEPA permits him to “regu-
late . . . importation . . . of . . . any property in which any
foreign country or a national thereof has any interest,”
§1702(a)(1)(B). Surely, the authority granted here is
“broad” and “expansive.” See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
758–759 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). It has “no ifs, ands, or
buts” either. Id., at 756. As a matter of ordinary meaning,
the term “regulate” means to “fix, establish or control,” “ad-
just by rule, method, or established mode,” “direct by rule
or restriction,” or “subject to governing principles or laws.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 1156 (5th ed. 1979); see also post, at
4. And tariffs do just that—they fix rules that control, ad-
just, or govern imports of “property in which any foreign
country or a national thereof has any interest.”
§1702(a)(1)(B).
Without question IEEPA is also “major legislation” de-
signed to address “big problems” and “crises,” West Vir-
ginia, 597 U. S., at 754, 756–758 (KAGAN, J., dissenting)
(internal quotation marks omitted), along with “emergen-
cies” that are “major in scope,” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 542
(KAGAN, J., dissenting). By its terms, the statute applies

only during declared national emergencies involving
“threat[s]” to the “national security, foreign policy, or econ-
omy of the United States.” §1701(a). And it tasks the Pres-
ident personally with responding to those emergencies, a
responsibility surely more in his “lane” or “wheelhouse”
than that of any other executive official. See West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 765 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Notably, too,
IEEPA grants the President the power to impose even
“greater restrictions” than tariffs, Alabama Assn. of Real-
tors, 594 U. S., at 769 (Breyer, J., dissenting), because the
statute also permits him to “nullify,” “prevent,” and “void”
imports, §1702(a)(1)(B); see also Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 539
(KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Why do my concurring colleagues read IEEPA so much
more narrowly than they have other broad statutory terms
found in other major legislation addressing other emergen-
cies? They say contextual clues justify a narrowing con-
struction here. See post, at 3–7. But what the concurrence
calls “context” looks remarkably like the major questions
doctrine’s rule that, when executive branch officials claim
Congress has granted them an extraordinary power, they
must identify clear statutory authority for it. See ante, at
13 (reciting the rule).
Take some examples. The concurrence points to the “un-
paralleled authority” the President asserts “to impose a tar-
iff of any amount, for any time, on only his own say-so.”
Post, at 6. In other words, the President claims an
“[e]xtraordinary” power. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723
(majority opinion). The concurrence observes that no “Pres-
ident until now understood IEEPA to authorize imposing
tariffs.” Post, at 6. In other words, the power is an “unher-
alded” one. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 722 (internal quo-
tation marks omitted). Along the way, the concurrence also
adds “a modicum of common sense about how Congress typ-
ically delegates” and “consideration of whether Congress
ever has before, or likely would, delegate the power the

Executive asserts.” Post, at 2 (internal quotation marks
omitted). In other words, the statutory text must be read
in light of “separation of powers principles.” West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 723.
Having borrowed all those concepts from the major ques-
tions doctrine, the concurrence then turns to the key statu-
tory terms before us—“regulate . . . importation”—and ob-
serves that they “sa[y] nothing” (at least not expressly)
“about imposing tariffs.” Post, at 3. And why is that fatal
to the President’s case? Because the President is attempt-
ing to exercise the “‘core congressional power’” over taxes
and tariffs, a power Article I of the Constitution vests in
Congress alone. Post, at 5 (quoting ante, at 8); see also West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 737 () (ex-
plaining that the major questions doctrine “protect[s] the
Constitution’s separation of powers,” and particularly Arti-
cle I, which vests “all federal legislative . . . [p]owers in . . .
Congress” (internal quotation marks and alteration omit-
ted)).
If my colleagues all but apply the major questions doc-
trine today, maybe they are simply recognizing what they
have in other separation of powers cases involving the del-
egation of legislative power: that “[t]he guidance needed is
greater” when the executive branch seeks to take “action[s]
[that] will affect the entire national economy.” FCC v. Con-
sumers’ Research, 606 U. S. 656, 673 (2025) (opinion for the
Court by KAGAN, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or
maybe my colleagues believe the power the President as-
serts here outstrips even those powers executive officials
asserted in our past major questions cases. But whatever
the case, my concurring colleagues’ course today suggests
that skeptics owe the major questions doctrine a second
look.
All of which leads me to take up the challenges they have
posed to it in the past. Is the doctrine really some “special
cano[n]” that has only recently “magically appear[ed]”?

West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 779 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
And is it really grounded in an “anti-administrative-state
stance” that prevents Congress from using executive
branch officials to perform “important work”? Id., at 780.
B
The major questions doctrine teaches that, to sustain a
claim that Congress has granted them an extraordinary
power, executive officials must identify clear authority for
that power. Far from a novelty, much the same principle
has long applied to those who claim extraordinary dele-
gated authority, whether in private or public law.
1
Examples stretch across many fields. Consider first the
common law of corporations. In early modern England, cor-
porations could be formed only with “an explicit, ex ante
and direct authorization.” R. Harris, Industrializing Eng-
lish Law: Entrepreneurship and Business Organization,
1720–1844, p. 17 (2000). That authorization could be given
by the Crown, an Act of Parliament, or a combination of the
two. Ibid.; see also id., at 19. Some of these corporations
exercised regulatory functions not unlike those performed
by modern administrative agencies. M. Bilder, The Corpo-
rate Origins of Judicial Review, 116 Yale L. J. 502, 516–
517, 519–520 (2006). Indeed, the “[i]nitial settlements in
Virginia and Massachusetts Bay, among others, were struc-
tured as corporations.” Id., at 535.
English law treated these corporations as having author-
ity to issue bylaws. But that authority was subject to re-
strictions, one of which was that corporations could not reg-
ulate on major subjects without express authorization.
Take Kirk v. Nowill, 1 T. R. 118, 99 Eng. Rep. 1006 (K. B.
1786). That case involved the Company of Cutlers, a corpo-
ration for makers of knives and other cutlery. See id., at
118–119, 99 Eng. Rep., at 1006. An Act of Parliament gave

the company broad authority to regulate its members. Id.,
at 118–121, 99 Eng. Rep., at 1006–1007. The company used
that authority to adopt a bylaw allowing its officials to enter
its members’ “workshops and warehouses” and search for
“deceitful and unworkmanly” cutlery. Id., at 121–122, 99
Eng. Rep., at 1007. After the company seized supposedly
unworkmanly forks, the aggrieved owner challenged the
company’s actions in court, arguing that the bylaw under
which it acted was “bad in point of law” because the power
to incur a forfeiture was not “expressly given to [the com-
pany] by Act of Parliament.” Id., at 118, 122–123, 99 Eng.
Rep., at 1008. Applying a clear-statement rule, the King’s
Bench declared the bylaw, and therefore the seizure, un-
lawful. Lord Mansfield explained that the “power of mak-
ing bye-laws to incur a forfeiture” was an “extraordinary
power” over and above the default powers of corporations
“created by charter.” Id., at 124, 99 Eng. Rep., at 1009. For
this reason, the power needed to be “expressly given” by the
company’s progenitor, Parliament. Ibid. Since no such
power had been clearly conferred, the seizure was unlawful.
See ibid.
The same principle applied in American law. In In re
Election of Directors of Long Island R. Co., 19 Wend. 37, 40
(N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1837), a New York court addressed a case
involving 2,700 shares of stock in the Long Island Railroad
Company that the company had declared forfeited. Ibid.
All agreed that the company had broad power to regulate
its shares. See id., at 41–42. Still, the court called the for-
feiture an “extraordinary penalty,” and held that no such
power had been “expressly conferred” on the corporation by
its charter. Ibid. In fact, the court borrowed the clear-
statement rule from Nowill: If “extraordinary authority . . .
is intended to be given, it must be by express words to that
effect.” Id., at 43 (describing Nowill in detail).
The court in Ex parte Burnett, 30 Ala. 461 (1857), pro-
ceeded similarly. That case involved the incorporated town

of Cahaba, Alabama. See id., at 464. The town set the price
of a liquor license at $1,000, fined James Burnett for failing
to obtain one, and eventually imprisoned him for not paying
the fine. See ibid. Burnett sought a writ of habeas corpus
and argued that Cahaba had acted beyond the scope of its
corporate authority. Ibid.
Without a clear-statement rule, Burnett’s argument
would have stood little chance. That’s because the town’s
charter granted it the authority “to make and establish all
such rules, by-laws, and ordinances, respecting the streets,
markets, buildings, . . . and police of said town, that shall
appear to them requisite and necessary for the security,
welfare, and convenience of said town, or for preserving
health, peace, order, and good government within the
same.” Id., at 467 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
charter even specifically gave the town the “privileg[e] of
granting licenses for retailing of spirituous and other liq-
uors.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Semanti-
cally, the town’s power was broad indeed and encompassed
liquor licensing. But the court sided with Burnett anyway.
Reasoning that the town’s exorbitant licensing fee effec-
tively banned the sale of liquor, the court held that Cahaba
did not enjoy such extraordinary “prohibitory” power be-
cause it was “not authorized by any express grant of power”
in the town’s charter. Id., at 469; see also id., at 466.
These cases are not outliers. Treatises confirm that the
extraordinary power principle was fundamental to munici-
pal corporations. A statute could “not by implication invest
[a] body with any extraordinary authority.” J. Willcock,
The Law of Municipal Corporations ¶226, p. 99 (1827). Ex-
traordinary powers required “express words to that effect.”
Ibid. And “[a]ny fair, reasonable doubt concerning the ex-
istence of power [was] resolved by the courts against the
corporation, and the power [was] denied.” 1 J. Dillon, Com-
mentaries on the Law of Municipal Corporations 145 (4th
ed. 1890).

The takeaway is simple enough. Early corporations often
functioned much like today’s executive branch, exercising
delegated regulatory authority. And, when interpreting the
scope of that authority, the common law had a clear-state-
ment rule that looked strikingly like the major questions
doctrine.
Historically, a similar precept applied in agency law. As
the leading early American treatise put it, instruments con-
ferring powers of attorney were “ordinarily subjected to a
strict interpretation.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Law
of Agency 80–81 (2d ed. 1844). So, for example, in Attwood
v. Munnings, 7 Barn. & Cress. 278, 108 Eng. Rep. 727 (K.
B. 1827), a principal had delegated broad power to an agent
to act “generally for him and in his name,” including in all
things “as should be requisite, expedient, and advisable to
be done in . . . his affairs and concerns, and as he might or
could do if personally acting therein.” Id., at 279–280, 108
Eng. Rep., at 728 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
agent then accepted certain debts on behalf of the principal.
Id., at 280, 108 Eng. Rep., at 728. The question for the court
was whether this action was within the scope of the agent’s
authority. Id., at 281, 108 Eng. Rep., at 728. The court said
no. Powers of attorney are “instruments to be construed
strictly.” Id., at 283, 108 Eng. Rep., at 729. And the power
of attorney contained “no express power” to accept debts, so
no such power had been given. Ibid.
Other examples abound. A power to sell casks of whiskey
did not include the “unusual and extraordinary” power to
offer a warranty against future seizures of the casks, unless
granted by “express authority.” Palmer v. Hatch, 46 Mo.
585, 587 (1870). Under a power of attorney, authority to
enter contracts for a principal was subject to “strict inter-
pretation” and generally did not authorize “contracts of an
extraordinary character” outside those “connected with [the
principal’s] ordinary business.” Reynolds v. Rowley, 4 La.
Ann. 396, 398–399 (1849). And a power to manage a mine

did not authorize an agent to borrow money for the mine’s
operations on the principal’s credit because there was no
“express authority” for such a departure from the “usual
manner” of running a mine. Hawtayne v. Bourne, 7 M. &
W. 595, 599, 151 Eng. Rep. 905, 906 (Ex. 1841). This was
true even “in cases of necessity,” id., at 599, 151 Eng. Rep.,
at 907, where the manager borrowed funds to address an
“emergency suddenly arising,” id., at 600, 151 Eng. Rep., at
907.
Much the same principle applied to executive officials.
Often, “[t]he legality of an executive action depended on the
relationship between the size of the asserted power and the
clarity of the underlying legal authority.” T. Arvind & C.
Burset, Partisan Legal Traditions in the Age of Camden
and Mansfield, 44 Oxford J. Legal Studies 376, 388 (2024).
Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029 (C. P. 1765), of-
fers an illustration. There, as part of an investigation for
seditious libel, the English Secretary of State claimed au-
thority to issue a warrant for the seizure of an author’s pa-
pers. Lord Camden declared the seizure unlawful, reason-
ing that power asserted by the executive “ought to be as
clear as it is extensive.” T. Arvind & C. Burset, A New Re-
port of Entick v. Carrington (1765), 110 Ky. L. J. 265, 324
(2022) (Arvind & Burset). Or, as another reporter described
Camden’s decision, “one should naturally expect that the
law to warrant [the exercise of power] should be clear in
proportion as the power is exorbitant.” 19 How. St. Tr., at
1065–1066. The seizure represented an extraordinary ex-
ercise of power, Lord Camden found, and no legal authority
clearly authorized it. See Arvind & Burset 324. Accord-
ingly, the warrant was unlawful and the seizure could not
stand. Id., at 332.
2
Perhaps unsurprisingly given this history, American
courts applied the extraordinary power principle when

Congress and the States started delegating new regulatory
powers to executive agencies in the late 19th century. Take
railroad commissions. After the Civil War, governments
worried about the increasing power of railroad companies
responded by creating new agencies and imbuing them with
broad regulatory authority. These bodies were among the
first modern administrative agencies. See West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 740 (). And when they
claimed some extraordinary delegated power, both state
and federal courts enforced a clear-statement rule. See,
e.g., Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 213 U. S. 175,
193–194 (1909) (declaring, in the course of interpreting a
state statute, that an “enormous power” “must be conferred
in plain language” “free from doubt”); Board of R. Comm’rs
of Ore. v. Oregon R. & Navigation Co., 17 Ore. 65, 77, 19 P.
702, 707–708 (1888) (When an agency exercises “powers
delegated to [it] by the legislature” to carry out “important
functions,” the text must “define and specify the authority
given it so clearly that no doubt can reasonably arise”); ICC
v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 167 U. S. 479, 505 (1897)
(holding a delegation of legislative power of “supreme deli-
cacy and importance” must be “clear and direct”); Gulf &
Ship Island R. Co. v. Railroad Comm’n, 94 Miss. 124, 134–
135, 49 So. 118 (1908) (“It is universally held that a railroad
commission . . . must be able to point to its grant of power
. . . in clear and express terms, and nothing will be had by
inference”).
The railroad commissions may have been the first, but
they were not the last. Whether executive officials claimed
the power to criminally punish noncompliance with regula-
tions, force employers to retain employees regardless of
their unlawful conduct, or regulate intrastate candy sales,
this Court held them to much the same standard. Because
their claimed powers were so substantial, executive officials
had to identify a “distinc[t]” authority for them, United
States v. Eaton, 144 U. S. 677, 688 (1892), a “clear

legislative basis,” United States v. George, 228 U. S. 14, 22
(1913), a “definite and unmistakable expression,” NLRB v.
Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240, 255 (1939), or
a “clea[r] mandate,” FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U. S.
349, 351, 355 (1941). Cf. Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO
v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 645 (1980)
(plurality opinion) (“In the absence of a clear mandate . . .
it is unreasonable to assume that Congress intended to give
the Secretary [of Labor] the unprecedented power over
American industry” he claimed).
It is no mystery why the Court proceeded this way when
interpreting legislative directions to the executive branch.
Article I of the Constitution vests all federal legislative
power in Congress, and Article II charges the executive
branch with seeing that Congress’s laws are faithfully exe-
cuted. In a very real sense, then, when it comes to legisla-
tive power, Congress is the principal and executive officials
are the agents. See generally G. Lawson & G. Seidman, “A
Great Power of Attorney”: Understanding the Fiduciary
Constitution (2017).
So what is the basis for the charge that the major ques-
tions doctrine represents some “magica[l]” innovation? See
West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 779 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Part of the answer may have to do with the fact that, in the
latter half of the 20th century, this Court began experi-
menting with a very different approach. The Court pushed
aside its long-held skepticism of claims to extraordinary
delegated powers and began affirmatively encouraging
them. Chevron deference is just one example of this phe-
nomenon, though a stark one. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837
(1984). That case established a presumption that was
nearly the opposite of the major questions doctrine: When
Congress failed to speak clearly, courts put a thumb on the
scale in favor of delegated power. Id., at 843–844. Given
that development, the longstanding principles animating

the major questions doctrine may have receded from view
for a time. After all, the two doctrines often applied in the
same places and counseled opposite results. But with Chev-
ron gone, so is the conflict. This Court’s application of the
major questions doctrine is not invention so much as return
to form.
C
Now turn to my concurring colleagues’ other charge: that
the major questions doctrine is premised on an “anti-admin-
istrative-state stance.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 780
(KAGAN, J., dissenting). It is important, they argue, to al-
low Congress to delegate expansive powers. Members of
Congress unfortunately “often don’t know enough—and
know they don’t know enough—to regulate sensibly on an
issue.” Id., at 781. Nor can Congress easily “anticipate
changing circumstances.” Ibid. For these reasons, Mem-
bers of Congress must rely on more adept and less con-
strained “people . . . found in agencies.” Ibid. Indeed, my
colleagues say, “administrative delegations . . . have helped
to build a modern Nation.” Id., at 782. And the major ques-
tions doctrine, they worry, could jeopardize all that “aston-
ish[ing] . . . progress.” Ibid.
This policy complaint, of course, is no reason to disregard
our precedents or longstanding legal principles. But, even
taken on its own terms, it is a bit perplexing. The major
questions doctrine is not “anti-administrative state.” It is
pro-Congress. Common-law courts understood that few
written instruments can anticipate every eventuality, and
that principals sometimes draft broad delegation language
to account for this. At the same time, courts appreciated
the corresponding risk that delegees could easily exploit
loose language in their commissions for their own benefit
and to the detriment of those they purported to serve. So
common-law courts often strictly construed delegated

powers, not because they were anti-delegee, but because
they were pro-principal.
The major questions doctrine performs a similar function.
Article I vests all federal legislative power in Congress. But
like any written instrument, federal legislation cannot an-
ticipate every eventuality, a point my concurring colleagues
have observed in the past. Id., at 781–782. And highly re-
sourceful members of the executive branch have strong in-
centives to exploit any doubt in Congress’s past work to as-
sume new power for themselves. The major questions
doctrine helps prevent that kind of exploitation. Our found-
ers understood that men are not angels, and we disregard
that insight at our peril when we allow the few (or the one)
to aggrandize their power based on loose or uncertain au-
thority. We delude ourselves, too, if we think that power
will accumulate safely and only in the hands of dispassion-
ate “people . . . found in agencies.” Id., at 781. Even if un-
elected agency officials were uniquely immune to the desire
for more power (an unserious assumption), they report to
elected Presidents who can claim no such modesty. See My-
ers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).
Another feature of our separation of powers makes the
major questions doctrine especially salient. When a private
agent oversteps, a principal may fix that problem prospec-
tively by withdrawing the agent’s authority. Under our
Constitution, the remedy is not so simple. Once this Court
reads a doubtful statute as granting the executive branch a
given power, that power may prove almost impossible for
Congress to retrieve. Any President keen on his own au-
thority (and, again, what President isn’t?) will have a
strong incentive to veto legislation aimed at returning the
power to Congress. Perhaps Congress can use other tools,
including its appropriation authority, to influence how the
President exercises his new power. Maybe Congress can
sometimes even leverage those tools to induce the President
to withhold a veto. But retrieving a lost power is no easy

business in our constitutional order. And without doctrines
like major questions, our system of separated powers and
checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual
and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.
That is no recipe for a republic.
This case offers an example of the problem. Article I
grants Congress, not the President, the power to impose
tariffs. Still, the President claims, Congress passed that
power on to him in IEEPA, permitting him to impose tariffs
on nearly any goods he wishes, in any amount he wishes,
based on emergencies he himself has declared. He insists,
as well, that his emergency declarations are unreviewable.
A ruling for him here, the President acknowledges, would
afford future Presidents the same latitude he asserts for
himself. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69. So another President
might impose tariffs on gas-powered automobiles to re-
spond to climate change. Ibid. Or, really, on virtually any
imports for any emergency any President might perceive.
And all of these emergency declarations would be unreview-
able. Just ask yourself: What President would willingly
give up that kind of power?
I recognize the concerns about the major questions doc-
trine. But it is not so novel as some have supposed. And it
serves Article I values we all share. My concurring col-
leagues all but endorse it today. I hope past skeptics will
give it another look.
II
Turn now to the second camp. If some have criticized the
major questions doctrine, others have responded by seeking
to soften its blow. Though joining today’s principal opinion
holding that “clear” statutory authority is required to sus-
tain the exercise of an “extraordinary” power, ante, at 13,
20, JUSTICE BARRETT has suggested that the major ques-
tions doctrine might be reconceived. On her view, the doc-
trine need not be understood as a “substantive canon

designed to enforce Article I’s Vesting Clause”—a “valu[e]
external to a statute.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 510
(concurring opinion). Instead, the doctrine might be
thought of as a “commonsense principl[e] of communica-
tion” that counsels “skepticism” when executive officials
claim extraordinary powers derived from Congress. Id., at
514, 516; see also post, at 1–4 (concurring opinion).
It is a thoughtful effort, but I harbor doubts. For one
thing, there is no need to reconceive our doctrine; past crit-
ics all but apply the doctrine today and their previous criti-
cisms fall flat. See Part I, supra. For another, this gloss on
our major questions doctrine presents problems. Com-
monsense principles of communication do not explain many
of our major questions cases—this one included. And if
common sense really does go so far as to embrace a rule
counseling “skepticism” of claims by executive officials that
Congress has granted them extraordinary powers, that is
common sense in name only. The reason for such skepti-
cism must be Article I, a “substantive” source “external” to
any statute.
A
Introducing her view that “commonsense principles of
communication” can sometimes help resolve disputes over
the meaning of statutory terms, JUSTICE BARRETT points to
an old chestnut. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512, 514 (concur-
ring opinion). Suppose a legislature used the phrase “who-
ever drew blood in the streets” in a criminal statute impos-
ing punishment. As a matter of “common sense,” JUSTICE
BARRETT says, it would “‘g[o] without saying’” that the law
doesn’t apply to a surgeon accessing a patient’s vein to save
his life. Ibid. That is because the phrase “drew blood” is
susceptible to two conventional idiomatic meanings: one
“applicable to violent encounters with man or beast” and
the other “to medical procedures,” A. Scalia & B. Garner,
Reading Law 357 (2012) (Scalia & Garner). And any

ordinary person faced with that phrase in a penal law would
find it obvious which meaning applies. Ibid.; see also Ne-
braska, 600 U. S., at 512 ().
The difficulty is, our major questions cases are different.
Often, little about them “‘goes without saying.’” Ibid. Take
FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120
(2000). There, the question was whether the FDA could
regulate tobacco products. Id., at 125. Looking only to com-
mon sense, the answer would have been yes. Congress au-
thorized the FDA to regulate “drugs,” which Congress de-
fined expressly and broadly as “‘articles (other than food)
intended to affect the structure or any function of the
body.’” Id., at 126. As a matter of common sense, nicotine
qualifies as a “drug” based on this statutory definition, as it
might even as a matter of everyday speech. West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 721–722 (noting the “colorable textual basis”
for the executive branch’s interpretation in Brown & Wil-
liamson). Still, we held the FDA could not regulate tobacco
products. Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–160.
Other cases follow suit. We have ruled that the term “air
pollutant” does not include greenhouse gases, even though
greenhouse gases pollute the air. Utility Air Regulatory
Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 316, 323–324 (2014). We have
held that the phrase “‘[r]egulations . . . necessary to pre-
vent the . . . spread of communicable diseases’” does not in-
clude eviction moratoriums, even without questioning that
eviction moratoriums were necessary to prevent the spread
of COVID–19, a communicable disease. Alabama Assn. of
Realtors, 594 U. S., at 761, 764. And we have said that clos-
ing coal power plants is not the “‘best system of emission
reduction,’” even while acknowledging that closing them
would reduce emissions. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 721,
732–735.
None of these cases can be readily explained by “com-
monsense principles of communication.” Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 514 (). None involved a

phrase like “drew blood” susceptible to two conventional id-
iomatic meanings, one of which any English speaker faced
with the law at issue might quickly rule out. Quite the op-
posite; in each case the agency had a strong argument that
the statutory language, commonsensically read, granted
the power it claimed. Meanwhile, all our major questions
cases can be easily explained by reference to a rule requir-
ing the executive branch to identify clear statutory author-
ity when it claims Congress has granted it an extraordinary
power. And that is a “dice-loading” rule, plain and simple,
one designed to protect Article I, a “[s]ubstantive . . . valu[e]
external” to the statutory terms at hand. Id., at 508.
Common sense not only fails to explain many of our major
questions cases. It doesn’t explain even some of the cases
JUSTICE BARRETT has held up as examples of commonsense
cases. In Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. 844 (2014), for
example, the Court confronted a statute that defined
“chemical weapon” to include “‘any chemical which through
its chemical action on life processes can cause death, tem-
porary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or an-
imals.’” Id., at 851; see also Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512–
513 () (discussing Bond). Despite
that broad definition, the Court held that “an arsenic-based
compound” didn’t fit the bill. Bond, 572 U. S., at 852, 866.
To reach that result, we did not use common sense alone.
How could we have? It hardly goes without saying that ar-
senic doesn’t qualify as a “chemical” which can cause “‘per-
manent harm to humans or animals.’” Id., at 851; see also
id., at 867 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (calling it
“beyond doubt” that the ordinary meaning of the relevant
statutory terms embraced the chemicals at issue). Instead,
we relied on a clear-statement rule grounded in the sub-
stance of the Constitution—namely, the federalism canon.
Id., at 860 (majority opinion) (“[W]e can insist on a clear
indication that Congress meant to reach purely local
crimes, before interpreting the statute’s expansive

language in a way that intrudes on the police power of the
States”). So Bond may well be like our major questions
cases, but that is only because it applied a clear-statement
rule grounded in another substantive feature of the Consti-
tution.
Consider as well the babysitter hypothetical JUSTICE
BARRETT has posed. Imagine a parent of young children
who hands a babysitter a credit card and says, “‘[m]ake
sure the kids have fun.’” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 513 (con-
curring opinion). Now suppose the babysitter takes the
kids on a road trip to an amusement park, “where they
spend two days on rollercoasters and one night in a hotel.”
Ibid. “Was the babysitter’s trip consistent with the parent’s
instruction?” Ibid. JUSTICE BARRETT believes the answer
is likely “no” as a matter of common sense. See id., at 513–
514.
Really, though, unless one is to believe children do not
“have fun” on rollercoasters and at hotels, the babysitter
hypothetical can be explained only with reference to some
“external” and “substantive” norm. Id., at 508, 513. And,
in fact, just such a norm is baked into the babysitter hypo-
thetical—one we encountered in Part I–B, supra. The
babysitter is exercising authority the parents have dele-
gated to her. She is acting as their agent. As a result, one
might expect a clear statement from the parents before the
babysitter may do something extraordinary, like take the
kids on a road trip.
This substantive norm about delegated powers not only
lurks beneath the surface of the babysitter hypothetical, it
“‘loads the dice’” against her. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 510
(). Doubtless, she would see it that
way. The babysitter would argue that a trip to an amuse-
ment park is “fun.” And she would be right under a com-
monsense understanding of the word. But because the
babysitter is exercising delegated authority, she cannot

exercise such an extraordinary power without clear author-
ization for it.
Notice, too, the same outcome is no longer guaranteed
when we remove the delegated power feature. If one parent
leaves the children with the other parent, the trip to the
amusement park might well be fine. No other contextual
clues are needed. See id., at 516 (agreeing with this). So if
the answer to the babysitter hypothetical seems a matter of
common sense to many Americans, that is only because the
substantive norms associated with parental delegations to
babysitter agents are so deeply rooted in our society. Say
the same instruction were given to a babysitter in a com-
munity where children are raised collectively, like a kib-
butz. Same answer? Hardly obvious.1
B
To be sure, in places JUSTICE BARRETT concedes that her
gloss on the major questions doctrine requires resort to
something more than “common sense” instincts about what
would “‘g[o] without saying’” to an ordinary English
speaker. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512 (concurring opinion);
see also post, at 2. Sometimes, she suggests, common sense
doesn’t just help illuminate the “most natural” meaning of
an idiomatic term like “drew blood” based on its presence in
a penal law. 600 U. S., at 508. Sometimes, she says, “com-
monsense principles of communication” go much further.
Id., at 514. So much so that they wind up dictating a rule
——————
1 Today, JUSTICE BARRETT protests that the foregoing discussion “takes
down a straw man.” Post, at 1 (concurring opinion). But it was JUSTICE
BARRETT who previously wrote that the major questions doctrine “grows
out of . . . commonsense principles of communication.” Biden v. Ne-
braska, 600 U. S. 477, 514 (2023) (same). And it was JUSTICE BARRETT
who used the various illustrations recounted above to suggest that our
major questions decisions can be explained by reference to the kind of
“common sense . . . that ‘goes without saying.’ ” Id., at 512. If JUSTICE
BARRETT now means to put all that to the flame, the major questions doc-
trine is better for it.

counseling “skepticism” of executive claims to extraordi-
nary delegated powers. Id., at 516. Why? Because,
JUSTICE BARRETT says, a “reasonable observer” consults
“our constitutional structure.” Id., at 515, 520. But if that’s
true, this version of common sense does require us to ac-
count for “values” entirely “external to a statute,” including
specifically the “substan[ce]” of Article I. Id., at 508. And
in so doing, this expanded version of common sense just be-
comes the substantive major questions doctrine by another
name.
Today’s decision illustrates the point. The principal opin-
ion gestures at “common sense.” Ante, at 8. But through-
out, this “common sense” is linked to “‘constitutional struc-
ture’” and “‘separation of powers principles.’” Ibid. The
principal opinion begins with the Constitution, observing
that Article I vests the tariff power in Congress, not the ex-
ecutive branch. Ante, at 5–6. The principal opinion re-
counts the President’s claim that Congress has “delegated”
an “extraordinary” amount of its tariff power to him in
IEEPA. Ante, at 8–9. And from there, the principal opinion
proceeds to apply a clear-statement rule. It acknowledges
that the ordinary meaning of the key statutory term in
IEEPA—the word “regulate”—is capacious, so much so that
it could be understood to “captur[e] much of what a govern-
ment does.” Ante, at 14. Still, the principal opinion rea-
sons, that is not enough to sustain the President’s claim be-
cause the statute does not “clear[ly]” grant him the
“extraordinary” delegated power he seeks. Ante, at 13, 20.
When it comes down to it, common sense serves as little
more than a segue to Article I’s Vesting Clause.
That is as it must be. The statutory terms contain no
ambiguity we could use (or need) “commonsense principles
of communication” to resolve. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514
(). This case is nothing like the
“‘drew blood’” illustration, where it might “‘g[o] without
saying’” that any ordinary person would immediately

understand which of two idiomatic meanings a penal stat-
ute employed. Id., at 512. Indeed, today’s principal opinion
does not even “attempt to set forth the metes and bounds”
of IEEPA’s key phrase “‘regulate . . . importation,’” ante, at
16, much less find the “best” or “most natural” meaning of
those words, Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 521 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring); post, at 1. Instead, we need go no further than
to recognize that IEEPA fails to “clear[ly]” authorize tariffs.
Ante, at 13, 20. And the only reason we can stop there is
because Article I—a “[s]ubstantive . . . valu[e] external to a
statute,” 600 U. S., at 508 ()—im-
poses a clear-statement rule when executive officials claim
Congress has afforded them an extraordinary authority.
There’s another problem too. The equivocation on
whether “commonsense principles of communication” in-
clude only those things that might “go without saying,” or
also include “external” and “substantive” Article I “values,”
leads to a further equivocation on how much “skepticism”
common sense might dictate when assessing an executive
official’s claim to an extraordinary delegated power. Com-
mon sense, we are told, does not impose a “‘clarity tax,’” but
it does add an “expectation of clarity.” Id., at 508, 514.
Common sense does not “‘loa[d] the dice,’” but it does coun-
sel “skepticism.” Id., at 510–511, 516. Common sense
means never “forgo[ing] the most natural reading of a stat-
ute,” post, at 3, but it always means “expect[ing that] Con-
gress [will] make the big-time policy calls,” post, at 2 (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted). I am uncertain what to make
of this, except that it seems to toggle between a clear-state-
ment rule and nothing at all.2
——————
2 To the extent JUSTICE BARRETT suggests any skepticism “com-
monsense principles of communication” might (or might not) advise de-
rives from a “ ‘practical understanding of legislative intent,’ ” rather than
“external” and “substantive” Article I “values,” that poses still further
(and familiar) problems. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 515 (concurring

I am certain of one thing: Our cases hold a clear state-
ment is required to support a claim to an extraordinary del-
egated power. We required Congress to “speak clearly” in
Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324. We demanded “clear congres-
sional authorization” in NFIB, 595 U. S., at 118. We did the
same in Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 506, and in West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 732, and we do so again today, ante, at 13. Nor
do I see cause for being quite so reluctant about acknowl-
edging this. The common law recognized many clear-state-
ment rules. See, e.g., Part I–B, supra. Our own cases have
applied a host of Constitution-enforcing clear-statement
rules as well. We just encountered the federalism clear-
statement rule in Bond. Add to the list clear-statement
rules against laws that might apply retroactively, waive or
abrogate sovereign immunity, or create enforceable rights
under the Taxing Clause—to name just a few. See, e.g.,
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265–268
(1994); Financial Oversight and Management Bd. for P. R.
v. Centro De Periodismo Investigativo, Inc., 598 U. S. 339,
346–347 (2023); Medina v. Planned Parenthood South At-
lantic, 606 U. S. 357, 383–384, n. 8 (2025). Maybe all these
rules could be recast as “common sense”—at least if com-
mon sense means taking account of the “external” and

opinion) (quoting West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (2022)). Down
that road lies all the pitfalls associated with reliance on legislative his-
tory and those associated with conflating unenacted legislative intent
with the law. Scalia & Garner 397; post, p. 1 (JACKSON, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment). Similar problems attend the notion
that the appropriate degree of skepticism due a delegation might turn on
what people “expect.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514, 520 (BARRETT, J., con-
curring); see also post, at 2 (same). JUSTICE BARRETT has offered no evi-
dence about what people “expect” when confronted with different con-
gressional delegations. And to the extent she believes their
“expectations” would reflect an appropriate consideration of the whole
“‘corpus juris,’ including the Constitution,” post, at 2, n. 1, that just cir-
cles us right back to the “external” and “substantive” Article I “values”
she strives so hard to sideline, see Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508 (BARRETT,
J., concurring).

“substantive” “values” found in “our constitutional struc-
ture.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 515 (BARRETT, J., con-
curring). But whatever the label, it hardly requires some
“judicial flex,” post, at 4, to recognize that the “external”
constitutional “values” at stake in our major questions
cases are no less weighty than those at play in other set-
tings where we routinely apply a clear-statement rule.3
III
That brings us to the third camp. My dissenting col-
leagues have defended the major questions doctrine in the
past, and they do so again today. Post, at 31–33 (opinion of
KAVANAUGH, J.). They agree that the doctrine is grounded
in the Constitution. Post, at 32. They agree that the doc-
trine requires us to deviate from “‘routine’” statutory inter-
pretation principles and instead place a “thumb on the
scale,” one requiring executive officials to identify “‘clear’”
congressional authorization when they seek to exercise
some “major” power. Post, at 33. But, my colleagues say,
IEEPA provides the clear statement needed to sustain the
President’s tariffs. Post, at 38–45. Alternatively, they sub-
mit, we shouldn’t apply the major questions doctrine to any
statute, like IEEPA, that implicates “foreign affairs.” Post,
at 45–49. And this exception, they add, is particularly war-
ranted here because Congress has historically granted the
——————
3Notably, past critics of the major questions doctrine have not hesi-
tated to apply many of these clear-statement rules. See Financial Over-
sight and Management Bd. for P. R. v. Centro De Periodismo Investiga-
tivo, Inc., 598 U. S. 339, 346–347 (2023) (opinion for the Court by KAGAN,
J.); Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U. S. 369, 455–456, n. 1
(2024) (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (collecting examples); West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 751, n. 7 () (same). Nor have they hesi-
tated to adopt and apply other clear-statement rules with far less
grounding in the Constitution than the major questions doctrine. See,
e.g., Bowe v. United States, 607 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2026) (slip op., at 9–
10); id., at ___–___ (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12–15); Boechler
v. Commissioner, 596 U. S. 199, 208 (2022).

President large discretion in setting tariffs. Post, at 49–53.
Once again, the points are thoughtful and merit careful con-
sideration.
A
My dissenting colleagues begin by taking the major ques-
tions doctrine as they find it. They accept that the Presi-
dent’s challenged actions are “of major economic and politi-
cal significance.” Post, at 33. They accept as well that he
must identify “clear” congressional authorization to sustain
those actions. Ibid. Still, the dissent maintains, IEEPA
clearly grants the President the tariff power he asserts.
To arrive at that conclusion, the dissent consults four
clues we have sometimes employed in our major questions
cases to help assess whether a statute clearly authorizes an
asserted power. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 746
(). The dissent formulates these
clues largely as I would. See post, at 35–38. But, to my
eyes, the dissent engages in a little grade inflation when
applying them.
First, is the President seeking to exercise an “unher-
alded” or “newfound” power based on a “long-extant” stat-
ute? Post, at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
dissent insists that is not the case here because President
Nixon imposed a 10 percent tariff on most imports in 1971,
and then defended that action in lower courts under a pre-
decessor to IEEPA, the Trading with the Enemy Act
(TWEA). Ibid. But the words “regulate . . . importation”
were added to TWEA in 1941. §301(1)(B), 55 Stat. 839.
Congress used the same language in IEEPA in 1977.
§203(a)(1)(B), 91 Stat. 1626. And in the 85 years of TWEA’s
existence with that language (and the 49 years of IEEPA’s),
that is the only time either statute has been invoked to im-
pose tariffs. Ante, at 10–11, 17–18. A single time, and one
never tested in this Court. Nor are these statutes seldom
used. “Each year since 1990, Presidents have issued

roughly 4.5 executive orders . . . and declared 1.5 new na-
tional emergencies citing IEEPA.” Congressional Research
Service, The International Emergency Economics Powers
Act: Origins, Evolution, and Use 20 (Sept. 1, 2025). That is
pretty strong evidence the President here seeks to “deploy
an old statute” in a novel way. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
747 ().
Second, how has the executive branch interpreted IEEPA
in the past? Post, at 40–41. The dissent says Presidents
have long understood IEEPA to permit them to impose tar-
iffs. Ibid. But for support, the dissent again relies on iso-
lated evidence about other statutes. It points to the mone-
tary exactions President Ford ordered under the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962. Post, at 17, 40. And, once more, it
points to President Nixon’s invocation of TWEA to support
his 1971 tariffs during lower court proceedings (though the
dissent brushes aside the fact that President Nixon initially
rejected the idea of relying on TWEA, see Brief for Carla
Hills et al. as Amici Curiae 12–14). Whatever one makes of
this history, it hardly reveals the kind of contemporaneous
and consistent executive interpretation that might advance
the dissent’s cause. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 747
(). To the contrary, the fact that no
President until now has invoked IEEPA to impose a duty—
even one percent on one product from one country—is tell-
ing. Id., at 748.
Third, is there a “mismatch” between the action the exec-
utive official seeks to take and his expertise? Post, at 41.
On this one, I agree with the dissent. If tariffs fall in any
executive official’s “wheelhouse” (and not Congress’s), it’s
the President’s. Ibid.; see also supra, at 6.
Fourth, is the President “relying on oblique, elliptical, or
cryptic language”? Post, at 41–42. The dissent says no be-
cause “[t]his case does not involve elephants in mouse-
holes.” Post, at 41 (internal quotation marks omitted). Put
another way, the dissent insists, the provisions of IEEPA

before us are not “ancillary” ones, but are designed to con-
vey significant powers. Post, at 43 (internal quotation
marks omitted). It’s a fair enough point as far as it goes.
But our cases ask not just whether a provision is a “mouse-
hole” or “ancillary.” They also caution against reading ex-
traordinary powers into “broad or general” statutory lan-
guage. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 746 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U. S. 277, 291 (2011) (“[C]lear
statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or gen-
eral language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or
without due deliberation” (internal quotation marks omit-
ted)). Indeed, and as we have seen, many of our major ques-
tions cases have found broad or general terms in significant
statutes insufficient to support a claim to an extraordinary
or unusual power. See Part I–A, supra. And here, the word
“regulate” is broad as can be. So broad that it could be read
to “captur[e] much of what a government does.” Ante, at 14.
As I see it, then, three of the four clues the dissent relies
on cut against it. It is important to add, as well, that as
helpful as these clues can be in helping courts spot when a
claimed power is not supported by clear statutory authority,
they do not represent some exhaustive checklist, nor does
satisfying one guarantee a claim will succeed. So, for ex-
ample, even if an asserted power is in the agency’s “wheel-
house,” we might rule (and have ruled) against the agency
if the power is “unheralded” because the statute has stood
for decades without being interpreted to convey the power
claimed. See, e.g., Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 144,
159–160.
Ultimately, the central question in any major questions
case remains whether the executive branch’s claim to an
extraordinary power is supported by clear statutory author-
ity. And, as the principal opinion explains at length, many
additional clues beyond those the dissent addresses confirm
that the President cannot meet that standard in this case.

These additional clues include the way the key statutory
term “regulate” is used elsewhere in the U. S. Code, how
Congress has delegated tariff authority in the past, and
other neighboring language in IEEPA itself. Ante, at 14–
15.
Contrary to the dissent’s charge, too, the principal opin-
ion’s application of the major questions doctrine today in no
way amounts to a “magic-words test.” Post, at 44. Of
course, if IEEPA included terms like “tariff ” or “duty,” that
would have sufficed. But, to borrow a phrase from the dis-
sent, “monetary exactions on foreign imports” would have
worked just as well. Post, at 17. Same goes for “tax on im-
ported goods.” Or any similarly clear term or phrase. But
IEEPA includes no such language, just a broad term that
could cover almost anything a government does. And re-
quiring specific rather than general language is just how
clear-statement rules work. See, e.g., Sossamon, 563 U. S.,
at 291.
B
If the President’s claim fails under our usual major ques-
tions test, the dissent says we should respond by carving
out an exception to it for cases (like this one) touching on
“foreign affairs.” Post, at 45.
On this score, I share a limited point of agreement with
the dissent. Like the nondelegation doctrine, the major
questions doctrine protects Article I’s Vesting Clause and,
for that reason, the doctrine does not apply where the Pres-
ident is exercising only his own inherent Article II powers.
Like the nondelegation doctrine, too, the major questions
doctrine may speak with less force where the President and
Congress enjoy “overlap[ping] . . . authority.” See Gundy v.
United States, 588 U. S. 128, 159 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., dis-
senting); see also C. Bradley & J. Goldsmith, Foreign Af-
fairs, Nondelegation, and the Major Questions Doctrine,
172 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1743, 1747 (2004) (Bradley & Goldsmith)

(explaining the “supposed foreign affairs exception” to the
nondelegation doctrine “is better understood as a qualifica-
tion that concerns situations in which a statutory authori-
zation relates to an independent presidential power”).
Doubtless, cases implicating overlapping powers can
arise in the field of foreign affairs. The Constitution, for
example, vests in Congress the power to raise and regulate
armies, but it also vests in the President the commander-
in-chief power. Compare Art. I, §8, cls. 12–14, with Art. II,
§2, cl. 1. Similarly, Congress enjoys the power to regulate
foreign commerce, but the President has power to negotiate
treaties and nominate ambassadors. Compare Art. I, §8,
cl. 3, with Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The President may even enjoy
some “residual” powers pertaining to foreign affairs under
Article II’s Vesting Clause endowing him with the “execu-
tive Power.” See S. Prakash & M. Ramsey, The Executive
Power Over Foreign Affairs, 111 Yale L. J. 231, 234 (2001)
(Prakash & Ramsey); but see C. Bradley & M. Flaherty, Ex-
ecutive Power Essentialism and Foreign Affairs, 102 Mich.
L. Rev. 545, 551–552 (2004). Given all this, it is easy
enough to imagine statutes and disputes under them that
implicate both congressional and presidential powers
where we might have reason to question whether the major
questions doctrine applies with its usual force.
The problem for the dissent is that none of this is relevant
here. Before us, the President concedes that he does not
enjoy independent Article II authority to impose tariffs in
peacetime. Ante, at 18–19. Nor does the President claim
“‘concurrent’” constitutional authority to issue his tariffs.
Ante, at 13 (citing Tr. of Oral Arg. 70–71). Instead, and to
his credit, the President admits the power to authorize tar-
iffs in peacetime is constitutionally vested in “Congress
alone.” Ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Therefore, the President relies entirely on power derived
from Congress, and that means the major questions doc-
trine applies in the normal way. See Bradley & Goldsmith

1796 (“IEEPA [is] not [an] authorizatio[n] that obviously
connect[s] to independent presidential power in ways that
would warrant the independent powers qualification”).
Because of this problem, the dissent must argue for a
much broader “foreign affairs” qualification to the major
questions doctrine. Rather than ask whether an independ-
ent, constitutionally vested presidential power is impli-
cated, the dissent would have us ask instead whether the
President seeks to use the statute in question for a foreign
affairs purpose—for example, as a “too[l]” to “incentivize a
change in behavior by allies . . . or enemies.” Post, at 50.
When he does, the dissent submits, the major questions doc-
trine should not apply. And that’s true, the dissent contin-
ues, even if the power the President asserts has “significant
domestic ramifications.” Post, at 51.
This new exception to the major questions doctrine would
have (enormous) consequences hard to reconcile with the
Constitution. Article I, §8, vests in Congress many powers
that touch on “foreign affairs.” Some of those powers were
expected to be (and are) the “principal objects of federal leg-
islation.” The Federalist No. 53, p. 333 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961) (J. Madison). They include not only the power to im-
pose tariffs, cl. 1, but also the power to establish uniform
rules of naturalization, cl. 4, appropriate money for armies,
cl. 12, and define and punish offenses against the law of na-
tions, cl. 10. Under the dissent’s view, all these legislative
powers and more could be passed wholesale to the executive
branch in a few loose statutory terms, no matter what do-
mestic ramifications might follow. And, as we have seen,
Congress would often find these powers nearly impossible
to retrieve. See Part I–C, supra.
Consider an example. Imagine Congress adopted a law
that arguably could be read to let the President borrow and
spend money during peacetime as he sees fit. A law like
that would represent an extraordinary delegation of Con-
gress’s power both to borrow “on the credit of the United

States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 2, and to spend money in support of
the “general Welfare,” §8, cl. 1, and would carry with it “sig-
nificant domestic ramifications,” post, at 51. But if an en-
terprising executive could also use the law as a “tool” for
affecting the behavior of “allies . . . or enemies,” the dissent
seemingly would have us exempt it from scrutiny under the
major questions doctrine.
The dissent’s exception is so broad it’s hard not to wonder
how it fits with some of our existing major questions prece-
dents. In West Virginia, the Court applied the major ques-
tions doctrine over a dissent expressing concern that doing
so would deny the EPA (and therefore the President) the
power to respond to “the most pressing environmental chal-
lenge of our time”—“[c]limate chang[e].” 597 U. S., at 753
(KAGAN, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).
A challenge, the dissent continued, that threatened conse-
quences global in scope, including “mass migration events[,]
political crises, civil unrest, and even state failure.” Id., at
754 (internal quotation marks omitted). Was West Virginia
a “foreign affairs” case? How about our major questions
cases addressing efforts to combat the global pandemic that
was COVID–19? See, e.g., NFIB, 595 U. S., at 114.4
——————
4The dissent suggests that trying to identify when an independent Ar-
ticle II authority is in play would prove “jurisprudentially chaotic.” Post,
at 53, n. 23. But as the foregoing discussion illustrates, the dissent’s al-
ternative “foreign affairs” test poses its own challenges. And it seems to
me only one is firmly rooted in the text of the Constitution. See Bradley
& Goldsmith 1747; see also Prakash & Ramsey 233 (“[O]ne would think
that the Constitution’s text ought to play the preeminent role in discern-
ing the Constitution’s allocation of foreign affairs powers”). In this case,
too, only one test promises any manner of “chao[s]” because all parties
before us readily agree that the Constitution affords the President no
independent power to impose peacetime tariffs. See H. Powell, The Pres-
ident’s Authority Over Foreign Affairs: An Executive Branch Perspec-
tive, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 527, 549 (1999) (“The President has no inde-
pendent power directly to regulate [or] tax . . . foreign commerce”).

Seeking support for its sweeping new exception, the dis-
sent points to three main precedents. Post, at 46–48, 53–
57. I do not see how any of them might sustain its view.
The first, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507 (2004), con-
cerned the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force
(AUMF), legislation which authorized the President to use
“all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,
organizations, or persons” responsible for the September
11, 2001, attacks. Id., at 510 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The dissent highlights the principal opinion’s
conclusion that the AUMF allowed the President to detain
enemy combatants even though the law did not mention
that power expressly. Id., at 510, 516–517 (opinion of
O’Connor, J.). And from this, the dissent draws the infer-
ence that any statute addressing foreign affairs should be
exempt from scrutiny under the major questions doctrine.
Post, at 54–55. But the dissent overlooks the fact that the
principal opinion reached the conclusion it did only because
it found detention of enemy combatants to be a traditional
“incident to war.” 542 U. S., at 518. And once Congress
declares war (or, likewise, authorizes the use of military
force abroad), that implicates the President’s commander-
in-chief powers. Put simply, Hamdi was a case of overlap-
ping powers. Ours is not.
Second, the dissent invokes Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453
U. S. 654 (1981). See post, at 55–56. At its heart, that case
involved an executive order by President Reagan suspend-
ing certain claims by U. S. citizens against Iran as part of a
settlement involving the release of American hostages held
there. 453 U. S., at 675. Just as we do today, Dames &
Moore held that the “terms of the IEEPA . . . d[id] not au-
thorize” the President’s actions. Ibid. Even so, the Court
proceeded to uphold those actions anyway, and did so based
in part on its view (right or wrong) that the President en-
joyed some “‘independent’” power to “enter into executive
agreements” suspending certain claims. Id., at 678, 682–

683. So unlike our case, Dames & Moore again involved
overlapping powers. Along the way, too, the Court empha-
sized (repeatedly) the “narrowness” of its decision and that
it should not be taken to “lay down” any “general ‘guide-
lines’ covering other situations not involved here.” Id., at
661; see also id., at 660, 688. To derive from Dames &
Moore a new general guideline exempting “foreign affairs”
cases from the major questions doctrine’s reach would thus
require us to disregard its own cautionary direction.
Third, the dissent cites United States v. Curtiss-Wright
Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304 (1936). See post, at 46–48.
There, the Court did suggest that nondelegation rules in the
field of “domestic or internal affairs” should differ from
those in the realm of “foreign or external affairs.” Curtiss-
Wright, 299 U. S., at 315. But what should we make of that
language? If it means that the nondelegation doctrine (and
perhaps, by extension, the major questions doctrine) must
account for the President’s independent Article II powers, I
agree.
But I would hesitate to read more into the decision than
that. Consider what was really at issue there. A statute
permitted the President to ban the transfer of one class of
goods (armaments). Id., at 312. It did so with respect to
two countries then engaged in a war (Bolivia and Para-
guay). Ibid. The President’s authority was conditioned on
a finding that a ban “‘may contribute to the reestablish-
ment of peace between those countries.’” Ibid. Before mak-
ing that finding, too, Congress directed him to consult
“‘with the governments of other American Republics.’”
Ibid. All told, then, the statute set forth the policy for the
President to pursue. It bounded his authority by limiting
his options with respect to a limited class of goods and coun-
tries. The statute further conditioned his exercise of those
options on a factual finding reached after consultation with
other nations. So whatever else might be said about
Curtiss-Wright, one thing is apparent: In upholding the

President’s actions under the law in question, the Court
hardly allowed Congress to hand off all of its enumerated
powers touching on foreign affairs to the President, the tar-
iff power included.5
C
If its effort to secure a broad foreign affairs exception to
the major questions doctrine won’t work, the dissent hints
at a more limited one specific to tariffs. Such an exception
makes sense, the dissent says, because “Presidents have
long been granted substantial discretion over tariffs.” Post,
at 52 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the dis-
sent contends, this tradition traces “back to near the Found-
ing.” Post, at 59. If the dissent were right about that, one
might hesitate before accepting the President’s concession
that this case does not implicate any inherent Article II au-
thority. But, at least as I read it, history offers the dissent
little to work with.
Americans fought the Revolution in no small part be-
cause they believed that only their elected representatives
(not the King, not even Parliament) possessed authority to
tax them. Declaration of Independence ¶19. And, they be-
lieved, that held true not just for direct taxes like those in
the Stamp Act, but also for many duties on imports, like
those found in the Sugar Act. E. Morgan & H. Morgan, The
Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution 72–74 (1995 ed.);
see 1 E. Stanwood, American Tariff Controversies in the
Nineteenth Century 60 (1903) (Stanwood); C. Van Tyne,
——————
5In places, the dissent also argues that the President’s inherent Article
II authority includes a wartime tariff power. See post, at 22–24; see also
Brief for Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae 3. But this only
highlights the dissent’s bind. Whatever the full scope of the President’s
Article II war powers may be (and the briefs before us reveal a healthy
debate whether they include the power to impose tariffs), those powers
are not implicated here. IEEPA is not a wartime statute, nor does the
President claim we are at war with the countries whose goods are subject
to the tariffs.

The Causes of the War of Independence 126–136 (1922); J.
Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and
Proved (1764), in The Collected Political Writings of James
Otis 119, 161–162 (2015); see also id., at xii (Introduction).
Americans later codified these beliefs in the Constitution.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the national govern-
ment was laden with debt and enjoyed few ways to repay it.
To address that problem, the framers afforded the federal
government new taxing powers in the Constitution. Art. I,
§8, cl. 1. Many thought these powers among “the most im-
portant” features of the new federal charter. See, e.g., The
Federalist No. 33, at 202–203 (A. Hamilton). But, con-
sistent with their view that only the people’s elected repre-
sentatives could constitutionally tax them, the framers
gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.”
Id., No. 48, at 310 (J. Madison). And to cement that role,
the Constitution required that “All Bills for raising Reve-
nue shall originate in the House of Representatives,” the
body most responsive to the people. Art. I, §7, cl. 1.
For much of the Nation’s history, this taxing power was
essentially a tariff power. The framers even considered
(and eventually rejected) the possibility of giving the fed-
eral government the power to tax only through tariffs. The
Federalist No. 35, at 211 (A. Hamilton). No surprise, then,
that Congress’s first exercise of its taxing power was a tariff
law. P. Ashley, Modern Tariff History 170–171 (2d ed.
1910). And until the 20th century, tariffs “accounted for
between 50 and 90 percent” of the federal government’s rev-
enue. J. Dobson, Two Centuries of Tariffs: The Background
and Emergence of the United States International Trade
Commission 1 (1976).
How did Congress exercise its all-important tariff power?
It debated every detail of the first tariff Act. Stanwood 39–
71. Ultimately, Congress said, imported malt would incur
a charge of 10 cents a bushel. Brown sugar one cent. Loaf
sugar three cents. And so on. Id., at 59. The first tariff Act

was set to last for seven years. Id., at 72. It lasted barely
one. Ibid. Soon, Congress was at it again, laying out an-
other exacting schedule of duties. Id., at 75–76. Through-
out much of the 19th century, Congress proceeded simi-
larly, enacting highly detailed tariff schedules one after
another. See F. Taussig, The Tariff History of the United
States 68–170 (8th ed. 1931).
An early debate over executive involvement in setting
tariffs demonstrates just how strongly Congress felt that
tariffs were a legislative business. In December 1791, Pres-
ident Washington told Congress that General St. Clair had
been defeated in the Northwest Indian War, and the coun-
try would have to increase the size of the army. Stanwood
104. That meant the government needed more money. In
response, a resolution was offered in the House of Repre-
sentatives to solicit advice from the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, Alexander Hamilton, on the best way to raise the addi-
tional revenue—including through new tariffs. 3 Annals of
Congress 437 (1792); Stanwood 105–106. Ultimately, Ham-
ilton’s advice was sought, but only after a debate over the
constitutionality of even asking a member of the executive
branch for advice on raising revenue. Ibid.; 3 Annals of
Congress 447.
To be sure, on later occasions Congress turned to the ex-
ecutive branch for more help still. But it usually did so to
address changing trade practices in foreign countries. And
in doing so, Congress set the important policies, with the
executive branch responsible for finding facts—like what
other countries’ trade policies were at any given moment—
or filling in the details. So, for example, Congress passed a
statute in 1815 to repeal any “discriminating duty of ton-
nage . . . whenever the President” was “satisfied” that other
countries’ “discriminating or countervailing duties” had
“been abolished.” Act of Mar. 3, 1815, ch. 77, 3 Stat. 224;
see also, e.g., Act of Jan. 7, 1824, 4 Stat. 2–3.

Given this history, it’s no surprise that the dissent relies
mostly on statutes and cases after 1890. Post, at 59. But
even they do little to support its claim. J. W. Hampton, Jr.,
& Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394 (1928), for example,
involved a law instructing the President to “investigat[e]”
the costs of production for American firms and their foreign
counterparts and issue tariffs to “equalize” those costs. Id.,
at 401, 409 (internal quotation marks omitted). The statute
the Court faced in Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S.
649, 681 (1892), spoke similarly. Even when Federal En-
ergy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548,
came along in 1976, the Court upheld President Ford’s im-
position of monetary exactions on a single class of products
under a statute that provided at least some guidance about
how he should implement the law. Id., at 559. And whether
correctly decided or not, that case lies a far step from this
one.
Before us, the President insists he may use IEEPA to
equalize foreign and domestic duties—or not. He may use
it to negotiate with foreign countries—or not. He may set
tariffs at 1 percent or 1,000,000 percent. He may target one
nation and one product or every nation and nearly every
product. And he may change his mind at any time for
nearly any reason. At least as I see it, history dating “back
to near the Founding,” post, at 59, does not support the no-
tion that Presidents have traditionally enjoyed so much
power. More nearly, history refutes it.6
——————
6Beyond the major questions hurdle, the dissent faces another, related
one: the nondelegation doctrine. There the problems are just as acute.
In recent decades, this Court has employed a relatively lax “intelligible
principle” test to police delegations. See FCC v. Consumers’ Research,
606 U. S. 656, 673 (2025); cf. Gundy v. United States, 588 U. S. 128, 157–
159 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (arguing for a more traditional test).
But recognizing that even the intelligible principle test poses challenges
for it, the dissent contends for an even laxer test yet in cases involving
“foreign affairs” and tariffs. Post, at 57–61. It’s an effort that fails for

IV
That leaves one final camp to consider. JUSTICE THOMAS
suggests that Congress may hand over most of its constitu-
tionally vested powers to the President completely and for-
ever. Post, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion). On his view, the
only powers Congress may not delegate are those that in-
volve “rules setting the conditions for deprivations of life,
liberty, or property.” Ibid. From this rule, it follows that
Congress may give all its tariff powers to the President be-
cause “[i]mporting is a matter of privilege.” Post, at 10–11.
And, as a result, this case does not implicate any “‘“separa-
tion of powers”’” concerns at all. Post, at 3 (quoting ante,
at 8).
It’s a sweeping theory. One that would require us to
reimagine much of our case law addressing Article I’s Vest-
ing Clause. And one that presents difficulties of its own.
First, I do not see how JUSTICE THOMAS’s theory resolves
all “‘“separation of powers”’” concerns in this case. Post, at
3 (quoting ante, at 8). Suppose for argument’s sake that
Congress can delegate its tariff powers to the President as
completely as JUSTICE THOMAS suggests. Even then, the
question remains whether Congress has given the Presi-
dent the tariff authority he claims in this case—or whether
the President is seeking to exploit questionable statutory
language to aggrandize his own power. See Part I–C, su-
pra. Put another way, JUSTICE THOMAS’s nondelegation so-
lution does not automatically solve the major questions
problem. As we have seen, when an executive official
claims Congress has delegated to him some extraordinary
power, the major questions doctrine requires him to identify
clear statutory authority for its exercise—a standard he
——————
reasons we have just seen. Even if the nondelegation doctrine should
apply differently when congressional legislation and executive actions
implicate inherent Article II powers, Gundy, 588 U. S., at 159, none of
that means it should do so where (as here) the President derives what-
ever authority he has only from Congress.

must satisfy even if Congress is free to pass to him the
power he seeks. Post, at 2–3. In fact, this Court has previ-
ously applied, with our colleague’s assent, the major ques-
tions doctrine in a case that appears, under his present
view, to involve a power that Congress could delegate
wholesale to the President. See Nebraska, 600 U. S., at
486–488 (involving the power to cancel federal student loan
debts, which on JUSTICE THOMAS’s account presumably
qualifies as a benefit or privilege, not a right to life, liberty,
or property). And, just as the major questions doctrine pre-
cluded the executive branch’s assertion of power in that
case, it does so here.
Second, even when it comes to the nondelegation doc-
trine, JUSTICE THOMAS’s theory raises many questions. I
appreciate that the doctrine may apply with less force in
certain areas, such as when Congress legislates in a way
that implicates one of the President’s inherent powers. See
Part III–B, supra; Gundy, 588 U. S., at 159 (GORSUCH, J.,
dissenting). But JUSTICE THOMAS would go much further.
On his telling, the doctrine applies only to Congress’s true
legislative powers, which he says include only those powers
addressing the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As
it turns out, only a small subset of Congress’s enumerated
powers in Article I, §8, fit that bill. See post, at 5–6 (listing
the powers to punish counterfeiters, tax “internal[ly],” and
regulate interstate commerce). Only those few powers are
exclusively vested in Congress and subject to review of any
kind under the nondelegation doctrine. All “other kinds of
power[s]” enumerated in Article I, §8—including the pow-
ers to borrow and spend money, declare war, and regulate
foreign trade—are not truly legislative and may be dele-
gated at will. Post, at 2. So Congress may hand them off to
the President completely and he has no need to worry about
legal challenges under even this Court’s (relatively lax)
nondelegation doctrine. No matter, too, that Congress

might find itself permanently unable to retrieve these pow-
ers. See Part I–C, supra.
But if all that’s true, what do we make of the Constitu-
tion’s text? Section 1 of Article I vests “[a]ll legislative Pow-
ers herein granted” in Congress and no one else. Section 8
proceeds to list those powers in detail and without differen-
tiation. Neither provision speaks of some divide between
true legislative powers touching on “life, liberty, or prop-
erty” that are permanently vested in Congress alone and
“other kinds of power[s]” that may be given away and pos-
sibly lost forever to the President. Post, at 2.
What do we make, too, of what the founders said about
Article I both before and after the Constitution’s ratifica-
tion? They regularly referred to powers in Article I, §8—
even those that do not touch on life, liberty, or property—
as legislative in nature. At the Constitutional Convention,
early drafts described the powers to regulate “foreign” com-
merce, “raise armies,” “equip Fleets,” “coi[n] . . . money,”
and “establish post-offices” as “legislative powers.” 2 The
Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 142–144 (M.
Farrand ed. 1966) (Farrand). James Madison wrote to Con-
gress in 1817 that “[t]he legislative powers vested in Con-
gress are specified and enumerated in the eighth section of
the first article of the Constitution.” 8 The Writings of
James Madison 386 (G. Hunt ed. 1908); see also 1 id., at
112, 133, 381 (noting, before the Constitutional Convention,
the “legislative power over captures,” and arguing borrow-
ing money is an “exclusive power of Legislation”).
Alexander Hamilton spoke similarly. 3 The Works of Al-
exander Hamilton 479 (H. Lodge ed. 1904) (Lodge) (discuss-
ing “[t]he legislative power of borrowing money”); 6 id., at
182 (describing “the legislative power of regulating trade
with foreign nations”); 2 id., at 197, 198 (calling of “the leg-
islative kind” and “of a legislative nature” the powers to
raise money and troops, “establish rules in all cases of cap-
ture by sea or land,” “regulate the alloy and value of coin,”

and “make all laws for the government of the army and
navy”). So did James Wilson. 1 Collected Works of James
Wilson 268 (K. Hall & D. Hall eds. 2007) (describing all the
Senate’s powers as “legislative powers,” with the exception
of the powers to try impeachments, concur in treaties, and
consent to the appointment of officers, matters addressed
outside Art. I, §8).
What do we make as well of early congressional debates?
In the Second Congress, for example, the House of Repre-
sentatives rejected on nondelegation grounds a proposal to
give the President a largely unfettered power to establish
postal routes, even though doing so hardly would have
touched on life, liberty, or property. 3 Annals of Congress
229–242. In the Fifth Congress, four Representatives like-
wise objected on nondelegation grounds to a bill that au-
thorized the President to raise an army of up to 10,000 men.
8 id., at 1525–1527, 1532, 1535 (remarks of Reps. Nicholas,
Gallatin, Baldwin, and McDowell). Though the bill ulti-
mately passed, see Act of May 28, 1798, 1 Stat. 558, it did
so apparently because it was deemed not to violate Article
I’s nondelegation principle—no Member of Congress re-
sponded that the principle was wholly inapplicable because
the delegated power was not one that involved setting con-
ditions for deprivations of life, liberty, or property. See 8
Annals of Congress 1525–1542.
What are we to do, too, with this Court’s nondelegation
precedents, which have never turned on JUSTICE THOMAS’s
view of life, liberty, or property? See J. W. Hampton, Jr., &
Co., 276 U. S., at 403, 409 (scrutinizing a delegation to ex-
ecutive officials to set customs duties); Panama Refining
Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 405–406, 422, 433 (1935) (hold-
ing unconstitutional a delegation to executive officials to
prohibit the transportation of petroleum products in inter-
state and foreign commerce); National Broadcasting Co. v.
United States, 319 U. S. 190, 196, 214–215, 225–226 (1943)
(scrutinizing the delegation of authority to regulate the

granting of broadcasting licenses); see also Sessions v. Di-
maya, 584 U. S. 148, 217 (2018) ()
(“[I]mpermissible delegations of legislative power violate
[the nondelegation] principle, not just delegations that de-
prive individuals of ‘life, liberty, or property’”).
Third, even if a distinction between true legislative pow-
ers and “other kinds of power[s]” were proper, post, at 2, I
do not see why the tariff power would fall in the latter cat-
egory and thus be something Congress could delegate away
wholesale, without scrutiny, and forever. JUSTICE THOMAS
suggests all that is possible because, at the founding, the
tariff power was considered a “‘prerogative right’” of the
British King. Post, at 11 (quoting N. Gras, Early English
Customs System 21 (1918)).
That seems doubtful. Tariffs may have been among the
King’s prerogative powers during the reign of Edward I.
See id., at 20–21; see also post, at 11, n. 3 (citing P. Einzig,
The Control of the Purse: Progress and Decline of Parlia-
ment’s Financial Control 65 (1959) (discussing the practices
“during the Middle Ages”)). But even before the year 1400,
Parliament had achieved some “victory over the King in the
matter of imposing import duties.” Id., at 108–109. And
after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, as this Court has put
it, Parliament “secured supremacy in fiscal matters.” Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Community Finan-
cial Services Assn. of America, Ltd., 601 U. S. 416, 428
(2024) (citing 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 306, 333 (1771)). “By the time of the American
Revolution, trade regulation was thus a prime topic of leg-
islative concern” in Britain. M. McConnell, The President
Who Would Not Be King 217 (2020) (emphasis added); see
also J. Chitty, Law of the Prerogatives of the Crown 163
(1820) (“[T]he King does not possess any general common
law prerogative with respect to foreign commerce”).
More importantly still, whatever the views in Britain
may have been, American revolutionaries hardly shared

some universal conviction that all manner of tariffs were a
matter of the King’s prerogative, or even something Parlia-
ment, lacking colonial representatives, could freely impose
on them. Though in the mid-1760s some colonists distin-
guished between “‘internal’” and “‘external’ taxation” and
“conceded [Parliament’s] right to raise revenue through du-
ties on trade,” “the inadequacy of [that] much overstrained
distinction” soon “became obvious.” B. Bailyn, The Ideolog-
ical Origins of the American Revolution 212–213, 215
(1967). Illustrative of the point, John Dickinson came to
“repudiat[e]” the distinction “flatly and formally” in his Let-
ters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, id., at 215, contending
instead that laws aimed at raising revenue, but enacted
without representation, were objectionable without “dis-
tinction . . . between internal and external taxes,” Letters
From a Farmer in Pennsylvania 39 (1774). See also supra,
at 36–37 (recounting colonial objections to the Sugar Act);
H. Unger, American Tempest 101 (2011) (observing that the
“import duties” in the Townshend Acts helped “incite Amer-
icans to rebel”). And, of course, it was duties on foreign tea
that triggered the Boston Tea Party. J. Ellis, The Cause
17–18 (2021). Are we really to believe that the patriots that
night in Boston Harbor considered the whole of the tariff
power some kingly prerogative?
As we have already seen, too, the growing American con-
viction that the peacetime tariff power is legislative and be-
longs only to the people’s elected representatives was later
reflected in both the Constitution and early congressional
practice. See Part III–C, supra. To that discussion, I would
add just this. The Articles of Confederation granted the
Confederation Congress authority to make commercial
treaties, but no authority to restrain “the legislative power
of the respective states” to impose “imposts and duties on
foreigners.” Art. IX (emphasis added). At the Constitu-
tional Convention that followed, where the tariff power was
transferred to the federal government, delegates likewise

referred to it as a “legislative power.” See, e.g., 3 Farrand
615; 2 id., at 142–143. And, during debates over the Jay
Treaty, Hamilton explained that he held no doubt that reg-
ulating foreign trade and raising money from it was a “leg-
islative power,” if one that could be constrained by treaty.
6 Lodge 182, 189–190, 196. Reflecting the same sentiment
that helped fuel the Revolution, he asked: “[W]hat legisla-
tive power can be more sacred?” Id., at 196.

For those who think it important for the Nation to impose
more tariffs, I understand that today’s decision will be dis-
appointing. All I can offer them is that most major deci-
sions affecting the rights and responsibilities of the Ameri-
can people (including the duty to pay taxes and tariffs) are
funneled through the legislative process for a reason. Yes,
legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be
tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem
arises. But the deliberative nature of the legislative process
was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the
Nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people’s elected
representatives, not just that of one faction or man. There,
deliberation tempers impulse, and compromise hammers
disagreements into workable solutions. And because laws
must earn such broad support to survive the legislative pro-
cess, they tend to endure, allowing ordinary people to plan
their lives in ways they cannot when the rules shift from
day to day. In all, the legislative process helps ensure each
of us has a stake in the laws that govern us and in the Na-
tion’s future. For some today, the weight of those virtues is
apparent. For others, it may not seem so obvious. But if
history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will
come when those disappointed by today’s result will appre-
ciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.
