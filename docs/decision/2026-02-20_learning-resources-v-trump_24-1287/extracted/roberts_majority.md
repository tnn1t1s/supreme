*JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE JACKSON join only
Parts I, II–A–1, and II–B of this opinion.

I
A
Shortly after taking office, President Trump sought to ad-
dress two foreign threats. The first was the influx of illegal
drugs from Canada, Mexico, and China. Presidential Proc-
lamation No. 10886, 90 Fed. Reg. 8327 (2025); Exec. Order
No. 14193, 90 Fed. Reg. 9113 (2025); Exec. Order No. 14194,
90 Fed. Reg. 9117 (2025); Exec. Order No. 14195, 90 Fed.
Reg. 9121 (2025). The second was “large and persistent”
trade deficits. Exec. Order No. 14257, 90 Fed. Reg. 15041
(2025). The President determined that the first threat had
“created a public health crisis,” 90 Fed. Reg. 9113, and that
the second had “led to the hollowing out” of the American
manufacturing base and “undermined critical supply
chains,” id., at 15041. He invoked his authority under
IEEPA to respond.
Enacted in 1977, IEEPA gives the President economic
tools to address significant foreign threats. 91 Stat. 1626.
When acting under IEEPA, the President must identify an
“unusual and extraordinary threat” to American national
security, foreign policy, or the economy, originating primar-
ily “outside the United States.” 50 U. S. C. §1701(a). And
he must “declare[] a national emergency” under the Na-
tional Emergencies Act. Ibid.; see 90 Stat. 1255. He may
then, “by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise,”
take the following actions to “deal with” the threat: “inves-
tigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regu-
late, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit,
any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, with-
drawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or
dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with
respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which
any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.”
§§1701(a), 1702(a)(1)(B).
President Trump declared a national emergency as to
both the drug trafficking and the trade deficits, which he

deemed “unusual and extraordinary” threats. He then im-
posed tariffs to deal with each threat. As to the drug traf-
ficking tariffs, the President imposed a 25% duty on most
Canadian and Mexican imports and a 10% duty on most
Chinese imports. 90 Fed. Reg. 9114, 9118, 9122–9123. As
to the trade deficit (or “reciprocal”) tariffs, the President im-
posed a duty “on all imports from all trading partners” of at
least 10%. Id., at 15045. Dozens of nations faced higher
rates. Id., at 15049. And these tariffs applied notwith-
standing any extant trade agreements. Id., at 15045.
Since imposing each set of tariffs, the President has is-
sued several increases, reductions, and other modifications.
One month after imposing the 10% drug trafficking tariffs
on Chinese goods, he increased the rate to 20%. See Exec.
Order No. 14228, 90 Fed. Reg. 11463 (2025). One month
later, he removed a statutory exemption for Chinese goods
under $800. Exec. Order No. 14256, 90 Fed. Reg. 14899
(2025). Less than a week after imposing the reciprocal tar-
iffs, the President increased the rate on Chinese goods from
34% to 84%. Exec. Order No. 14259, 90 Fed. Reg. 15509
(2025). The very next day, he increased the rate further
still, to 125%. Exec. Order No. 14266, 90 Fed. Reg. 15625,
15626 (2025). This brought the total effective tariff rate on
most Chinese goods to 145%. The President has also shifted
sets of goods into and out of the reciprocal tariff framework.
See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14360, 90 Fed. Reg. 54091 (2025)
(exempting from reciprocal tariffs beef, fruits, coffee, tea,
spices, and some fertilizers); Exec. Order No. 14346, 90 Fed.
Reg. 43737 (2025). And he has issued a variety of other ad-
justments. See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14358, 90 Fed. Reg.
50729, 50730 (2025) (extending “the suspension of height-
ened reciprocal tariffs” on Chinese imports).
B
Petitioners in Learning Resources and respondents in
V.O.S. Selections filed suit, alleging that IEEPA does not

authorize the reciprocal or drug trafficking tariffs. The
Learning Resources plaintiffs—two small businesses—sued
in the United States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia. The V.O.S. Selections plaintiffs—five small busi-
nesses and 12 States—sued in the United States Court of
International Trade (CIT).
The Government moved to transfer the Learning Re-
sources case to the CIT. It argued that the District Court
lacked jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1581(i)(1), which
gives the CIT “exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action com-
menced against” the Government “that arises out of any
law of the United States providing for . . . tariffs” or their
“administration and enforcement.” The District Court de-
nied that motion and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a
preliminary injunction, concluding that IEEPA did not
grant the President the power to impose tariffs. 784
F. Supp. 3d 209 (DC 2025).
In the V.O.S. Selections case, the CIT granted the plain-
tiffs’ motion for summary judgment. 772 F. Supp. 3d 1350
(2025). The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed in
relevant part. 149 F. 4th 1312 (2025). It first concluded
that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction because the plain-
tiffs’ claims arose out of modifications to the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Id., at 1329.
On the merits, it agreed with the CIT that IEEPA’s grant
of authority to “regulate . . . importation” did not authorize
the challenged tariffs, which “are unbounded in scope,
amount, and duration.” Id., at 1338. Judge Cunningham
concurred (for four judges), reasoning that IEEPA did not
authorize the President to impose any tariffs. Id., at 1340.
Judge Taranto dissented (for four judges), concluding that
IEEPA authorized the challenged tariffs. Id., at 1348.
The Government filed a motion to expedite and a petition
for certiorari in V.O.S. Selections, and the Learning Re-
sources plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari before

judgment. We granted the motion and petitions and con-
solidated the cases. 606 U. S. 1050 (2025).1
II
Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section
1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA—“regulate” and “importation”—the
President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs
on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate,
for any amount of time. Those words cannot bear such
weight.
A

Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution sets forth the pow-
ers of the Legislative Branch. The first Clause of that pro-
vision specifies that “The Congress shall have Power To lay
and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.” It is no
accident that this power appears first. The power to tax
was, Alexander Hamilton explained, “the most important of
the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union.”
The Federalist No. 33, pp. 202–203 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).
It is both a “power to destroy,” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316, 431 (1819), and a power “necessary to the ex-
istence and prosperity of a nation”—“the one great power
upon which the whole national fabric is based.” Nicol v.
Ames, 173 U. S. 509, 515 (1899).
——————
1We agree with the Federal Circuit that the V.O.S. Selections case falls
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIT. The plaintiffs’ challenges
“arise[ ] out of ” modifications to the HTSUS. 28 U. S. C. §1581(i)(1).
Where, as here, such modifications are made under an “Act[] affecting
import treatment,” 19 U. S. C. §2483, they are “considered to be statu-
tory provisions of law for all purposes,” §3004(c)(1)(C). Thus, the plain-
tiffs’ challenges “arise[] out of [a] law of the United States providing for
. . . tariffs.” 28 U. S. C. §1581(i)(1). For the same reasons, the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction in
the Learning Resources case.

The power to impose tariffs is “very clear[ly] . . . a branch
of the taxing power.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 201
(1824). “A tariff,” after all, “is a tax levied on imported
goods and services.” Congressional Research Service
(CRS), C. Casey, U. S. Tariff Policy: Overview 1 (2025). And
tariffs “raise[] revenue,” West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,
512 U. S. 186, 193 (1994)—the defining feature of a tax,
United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22, 28, and n. 4 (1953);
Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, 514 (1937). In-
deed, the Framers expected that the Government would for
“a long time depend . . . chiefly on” tariffs for revenue. The
Federalist No. 12, at 93 (A. Hamilton). Little wonder, then,
that the First Congress’s first exercise of its taxing power
(and its second enacted law, right after the one providing
for the new officials to take an oath) was a tariff law. See
Act of July 4, 1789, ch. 2, 1 Stat. 24.
Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance, and
having just fought a revolution motivated in large part by
“taxation without representation,” the Framers gave Con-
gress “alone . . . access to the pockets of the people.” The
Federalist No. 48, at 310 (J. Madison); see also Declaration
of Independence ¶19. They required “All Bills for raising
Revenue [to] originate in the House of Representatives.”
U. S. Const., Art. I, §7, cl. 1. And in doing so, they ensured
that only the House could “propose the supplies requisite
for the support of government,” thereby reducing “all the
overgrown prerogatives of the other branches.” The Feder-
alist No. 58, at 359 (J. Madison). They did not vest any part
of the taxing power in the Executive Branch. See Nicol, 173
U. S., at 515 (“[T]he whole power of taxation rests with Con-
gress”).
The Government thus concedes, as it must, that the Pres-
ident enjoys no inherent authority to impose tariffs during
peacetime. Tr. of Oral Arg. 70–71. And it does not defend
the challenged tariffs as an exercise of the President’s
warmaking powers. The United States, after all, is not at

war with every nation in the world. The Government in-
stead relies exclusively on IEEPA. It reads the words “reg-
ulate” and “importation” to effect a sweeping delegation of
Congress’s power to set tariff policy—authorizing the Pres-
ident to impose tariffs of unlimited amount and duration,
on any product from any country. 50 U. S. C.
§1702(a)(1)(B).
2
We have long expressed “reluctan[ce] to read into ambig-
uous statutory text” extraordinary delegations of Con-
gress’s powers. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723
(2022) (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573
U. S. 302, 324 (2014)). In Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477
(2023), for example, we declined to read authorization to
“waive or modify” statutory or regulatory provisions appli-
cable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of
power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt. Id., at
494 (quoting 20 U. S. C. §1098bb(a)(1)). In West Virginia v.
EPA, we declined to read authorization to determine the
“best system of emission reduction” as a delegation of power
to force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal.
597 U. S., at 732 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §7411(a)(1)). And in
National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA, 595
U. S. 109 (2022) (per curiam), we declined to read authori-
zation to ensure “safe and healthful working conditions” as
a delegation of power to impose a vaccine mandate on 84
million Americans. Id., at 114, 117 (quoting 29 U. S. C.
§651(b)); see also, e.g., Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. 758, 764–765
(2021) (per curiam); King v. Burwell, 576 U. S. 473, 485–
486 (2015); Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324.
We have described several of these cases as “major ques-
tions” cases. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 505; West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 732; see also FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-
bacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159 (2000) (citing S. Breyer,

Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin.
L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986)). In each, the Government claimed
broad, expansive power on an uncertain statutory basis.
And in each, the statutory text might “[a]s a matter of defi-
nitional possibilities” have been read to delegate the as-
serted power. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 732 (internal
quotation marks omitted). But “context” counseled “skepti-
cism.” Id., at 721, 732. That context included not just other
language within the statute, but “constitutional structure”
and “common sense.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512, 515
(). “[B]oth separation of powers
principles and a practical understanding of legislative in-
tent” suggested Congress would not have delegated “highly
consequential power” through ambiguous language. West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723–724.
These considerations apply with particular force where,
as here, the purported delegation involves the core congres-
sional power of the purse. “Congress would likely . . . in-
tend[] for itself” the “basic and consequential tradeoffs,”
id., at 730, inherent in uses of this “most complete and ef-
fectual weapon,” The Federalist No. 58, at 359. And if Con-
gress were to relinquish that weapon to another branch, a
“reasonable interpreter” would expect it to do so “‘clearly.’”
Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514–515 ()
(quoting Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324).
What common sense suggests, congressional practice con-
firms. When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it
has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.
Congress has consistently used words like “duty” in stat-
utes delegating authority to impose tariffs. (A customs
“duty” is simply “the federal tax levied on goods shipped
into the United States.” Black’s Law Dictionary 638 (12th
ed. 2024).) See, e.g., 19 U. S. C. §1338(d) (“rates of duty”);
§2132(a) (“temporary import surcharge . . . in the form of
duties”); §2253(a)(3)(A) (“duty on the imported article”);
§2411(c)(1)(B) (“duties or other import restrictions”). It has

capped the amount and duration of tariffs. See, e.g.,
§1338(d) (50% cap); §2132(a) (15% cap, 150-day time limit);
§2253(e) (50% cap, phasedown requirement after one year).
And it has conditioned exercise of the tariff power on de-
manding procedural prerequisites. See, e.g., §2252 (inves-
tigation by the United States International Trade Commis-
sion, public hearings, report of findings and
recommendation); §§2411–2414 (investigation by the
United States Trade Representative, consultation with rel-
evant country and interested parties, publication of find-
ings).2
Against this backdrop of clear and limited delegations,
the Government reads IEEPA to give the President power
to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs. On this reading,
moreover, the President is unconstrained by the significant
procedural limitations in other tariff statutes and free to
issue a dizzying array of modifications at will. See supra,
at 3. All it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a
Presidential declaration of emergency, which the Govern-
ment asserts is unreviewable. Brief for Federal Parties 42.
And the only way of restraining the exercise of that power
is a veto-proof majority in Congress. See 50 U. S. C.
§1622(a)(1) (requiring a “joint resolution” “enacted into law”
to terminate a national emergency). That view, if credited,
would “represent[] a ‘transformative expansion’” of the
President’s authority over tariff policy, West Virginia, 597
——————
2The same is true of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,
76 Stat. 877, which we have held authorizes sector-specific import “li-
cense fee[s].” Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.,
426 U. S. 548, 571 (1976). Section 232(a) expressly references “duties.”
19 U. S. C. §1862(a); see infra, at 19. And Section 232(c) authorizes the
President to “adjust the imports” of an “article,” §1862(c), but only after
the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of De-
fense, conducts an investigation and prepares a report finding that the
“article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security,”
§1862(b).

U. S., at 724 (quoting Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324), and in-
deed—as demonstrated by the exercise of that authority in
this case—over the broader economy as well. See Congres-
sional Budget Office, CBO’s Current View of the Economy
From 2025 to 2028, p. 5 (Sept. 2025); Brief for Federal Par-
ties 2–3. It would replace the longstanding executive-legis-
lative collaboration over trade policy with unchecked Pres-
idential policymaking. See CRS, Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) and the Role of Congress in Trade Policy
(2015). Congress seldom effects such sea changes through
“vague language.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 724.
It is also telling that in IEEPA’s “half century of exist-
ence,” no President has invoked the statute to impose any
tariffs—let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope. Na-
tional Federation of Independent Business, 595 U. S., at
119.3 Presidents have, by contrast, regularly invoked
IEEPA for other purposes. CRS, C. Casey, J. Elsea, & L.
Rosen, The International Emergency Economic Powers Act:
Origins, Evolution, and Use 18–21 (2025). At the same
time, they have invoked other statutes—but never
IEEPA—to impose tariffs, on products ranging from car
tires to washing machines. See, e.g., Presidential Procla-
mation No. 8414, 3 CFR 115 (2009 Comp.); Presidential
——————
3Indeed, even before IEEPA was enacted, only one President relied on
its predecessor, the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), ch. 106, 40
Stat. 411, to impose tariffs—and then only as a post hoc defense to a legal
challenge. See Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 36 Fed. Reg. 15724
(1971) (initially invoking the Tariff Act of 1930 and Trade Expansion Act
of 1962); United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 572 (CCPA
1975). Those tariffs were also of limited amount, duration, and scope.
See id., at 568–569, 577–578 (noting that the 10-percent surcharge was
described by President Nixon as “ ‘a temporary measure,’ ” was in effect
less than five months, applied only to “articles which had been the sub-
ject of prior tariff concessions,” and was capped at congressionally au-
thorized rates); Economic Report of the President 70 (1972) (“When all
exceptions to the 10-percent rule were taken into account, the effective
rate of surcharge came down to 4.8 percent”).

Proclamation No. 9694, 83 Fed. Reg. 3553 (2018). And
those tariffs did not “even beg[in] to approach the size or
scope” of the IEEPA tariffs at issue here. Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 502 (quoting Alabama Assn., 594 U. S., at 765).
The “‘lack of historical precedent’” for the IEEPA tariffs,
“coupled with the breadth of authority” that the President
now claims, “is a ‘telling indication’” that the tariffs extend
beyond the President’s “legitimate reach.” National Feder-
ation of Independent Business, 595 U. S., at 119 (quoting
Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 505 (2010)).
The “‘economic and political significance’” of the author-
ity the President has asserted likewise “provide[s] a ‘reason
to hesitate before concluding that Congress’ meant to confer
such authority.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 721 (quoting
Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–160). The Presi-
dent’s assertion here of broad “statutory power over the na-
tional economy” is “extravagant” by any measure. Utility
Air, 573 U. S., at 324. And as the Government admits—
indeed, boasts—the economic and political consequences of
the IEEPA tariffs are astonishing. The Government points
to projections that the tariffs will reduce the national deficit
by $4 trillion, and that international agreements reached in
reliance on the tariffs could be worth $15 trillion. Brief for
Federal Parties 3, 11. In the President’s view, whether “we
are a rich nation” or a “poor” one hangs in the balance. Id.,
at 2. These stakes dwarf those of other major questions
cases. See, e.g., Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 483 ($430 billion);
Alabama Assn., 594 U. S., at 764 (nearly $50 billion); West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 714 (“billions of dollars in compliance
costs”). As in those cases, “a reasonable interpreter would
[not] expect” Congress to “pawn[]” such a “big-time policy
call[] . . . off to another branch.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at
515 ().

The Government and the principal dissent attempt to
avoid application of the major questions doctrine on several
grounds. None is convincing.
The Government argues first that the doctrine should not
apply to emergency statutes. Brief for Federal Parties 35–
36. But this argument is nearly identical to one it already
advanced in Nebraska. There, the Government contended
that a different emergency statute should be interpreted
broadly because its “whole point” was to provide “substan-
tial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies.”
600 U. S., at 500 (internal quotation marks omitted). We
rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here
as well. “Emergency powers,” after all, “tend to kindle
emergencies.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
U. S. 579, 650 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). Dozens of
IEEPA emergencies remain ongoing today, including the
first—declared over four decades ago in response to the Ira-
nian hostage crisis. CRS, Casey, International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, at 20. And as the Framers under-
stood, emergencies can “afford a ready pretext for usurpa-
tion” of congressional power. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 650
(Jackson, J., concurring). Where Congress has reason to be
worried about its powers “slipping through its fingers,” id.,
at 654, we in turn have every reason to expect Congress to
use clear language to effectuate unbounded delegations—
particularly of its “one great power,” Nicol, 173 U. S., at
515.
The Government’s and the principal dissent’s proposed
foreign affairs exception fares no better. Brief for Federal
Parties 34–35; post, at 45–57 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).
As a general matter, the President of course enjoys some
“independent constitutional power[s]” over foreign affairs
“even without congressional authorization.” FCC v. Con-
sumers’ Research, 606 U. S. 656, 707 (2025) (KAVANAUGH,
J., concurring). And Congress certainly may intend to “give
the President substantial authority and flexibility” in many

foreign affairs or national security contexts. Post, at 48
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (quoting Consumers’ Research,
606 U. S., at 706 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring)). But
“flip[ping]” the “presumption” under the major questions
doctrine, Brief for Federal Parties 34, makes little sense
when it comes to tariffs. As the Government admits, the
President and Congress do not “enjoy concurrent constitu-
tional authority” to impose tariffs during peacetime. Ibid.;
Tr. of Oral Arg. 70–71. The Framers gave that power to
“Congress alone”—notwithstanding the obvious foreign af-
fairs implications of tariffs. Merritt v. Welsh, 104 U. S. 694,
700 (1882). And whatever may be said of other powers that
implicate foreign affairs, we would not expect Congress to
relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or with-
out careful limits.
The central thrust of the Government’s and the principal
dissent’s proposed exceptions appears to be that ambiguous
delegations in statutes addressing “the most major of major
questions” should necessarily be construed broadly. Brief
for Federal Parties 35. But it simply does not follow from
the fact that a statute deals with major problems that it
should be read to delegate all major powers for which there
may be a “colorable textual basis.” West Virginia, 597 U. S.,
at 722. It is in precisely such cases that we should be alert
to claims that sweeping delegations—particularly delega-
tions of core congressional powers—“lurk[]” in “ambiguous
statutory text.” Id., at 723 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). There is no major questions exception to the major
questions doctrine.
Accordingly, the President must “point to clear congres-
sional authorization” to justify his extraordinary assertion
of the power to impose tariffs. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 506
(internal quotation marks omitted). He cannot.

B
To begin, IEEPA authorizes the President to “investigate,
block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, di-
rect and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit . . . impor-
tation or exportation.” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B). Absent
from this lengthy list of powers is any mention of tariffs or
duties. That omission is notable in light of the significant
but specific powers Congress did go to the trouble of nam-
ing. It stands to reason that had Congress intended to con-
vey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs,
it would have done so expressly—as it consistently has in
other tariff statutes. See supra, at 8; accord, post, at 11, 26–
27 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).
The power to “regulate . . . importation” does not fill that
void. “Regulate,” as that term is ordinarily used, means to
“fix, establish, or control; to adjust by rule, method, or es-
tablished mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to
governing principles or laws.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1156
(5th ed. 1979); see also Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596
U. S. 685, 697 (2022). This definition captures much of
what a government does on a day-to-day basis. Indeed, if
“regulate” is as broad as the principal dissent suggests,
post, at 10–11, then the other eight verbs in §1702(a)(1)(B)
are simply wasted ink. But the facial breadth of “regulate”
places in stark relief what the term is not usually thought
to include: taxation. The U. S. Code is replete with statutes
granting the Executive the authority to “regulate” someone
or something. Yet the Government cannot identify any
statute in which the power to regulate includes the power
to tax. The Government concedes, for example, that the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission cannot tax the trading
of securities, even though it is expressly authorized to “reg-
ulate the trading of . . . securities.” 15 U. S. C. §78i(h)(1);
see Brief for Federal Parties 31–32. We are therefore skep-
tical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a

delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotid-
ian power to “regulate.”
Taxes, to be sure, may accomplish regulatory ends. See
Sonzinsky, 300 U. S., at 513; Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 201–
202. But it does not follow that the power to regulate some-
thing includes the power to tax it as a means of regulation.
Congressional practice suggests as much. When Congress
addresses both the power to regulate and the power to tax,
it does so separately and expressly. See, e.g., 16 U. S. C.
§460bbb–9(a) (distinguishing between the power to “tax
persons, franchise, or private property” on lands and the
power “to regulate the private lands”); 2 U. S. C.
§622(8)(B)(i) (“government-sponsored enterprise” does not
have the “power to tax or to regulate interstate commerce”).
That is unsurprising, as the “power to regulate commerce”
is “entirely distinct from the right to levy taxes.” Gibbons,
9 Wheat., at 201. That Congress did not grant those au-
thorities separately here is strong evidence that “regulate”
in IEEPA does not include taxation.
A contrary reading would render IEEPA partly unconsti-
tutional. IEEPA authorizes the President to “regulate . . .
importation or exportation.” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B) (em-
phasis added). Taxing exports, however, is expressly for-
bidden by the Constitution. Art. I, §9, cl. 5.
The “neighboring words” with which “regulate” “is asso-
ciated” also suggest that Congress did not intend for “regu-
late” to include the revenue-raising power. United States v.
Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008). “Regulate” is one of
nine verbs listed in §1702(a)(1)(B). Each authorizes a dis-
tinct action a President might take in sanctioning foreign
actors or controlling domestic actors engaged in foreign
commerce—blocking imports, for example, or prohibiting
transactions. Presidential practice under IEEPA demon-
strates as much. See CRS, Casey, International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, at 79–106 (Table A–3); see, e.g., Exec.
Order No. 13194, 3 CFR 741 (2001 Comp.) (blocking

importation of diamonds from insurgent regime in Sierra
Leone); Exec. Order No. 12947, 3 CFR 319 (1995 Comp.)
(prohibiting transactions with those “who threaten to dis-
rupt the Middle East peace process”). None of IEEPA’s au-
thorities includes the distinct and extraordinary power to
raise revenue. And the fact that no President has ever
found such power in IEEPA is strong evidence that it does
not exist. See supra, at 10; FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312
U. S. 349, 351–352 (1941).
We do not attempt to set forth the metes and bounds of
the President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation” un-
der IEEPA. That “interpretive question” is “not at issue” in
this case, and any answer would be “plain dicta.” West Vir-
ginia, 597 U. S., at 734–735, and n. 5. Our task today is to
decide only whether the power to “regulate . . . importa-
tion,” as granted to the President in IEEPA, embraces the
power to impose tariffs. It does not.4
The Government, echoed point-for-point by the principal
dissent, marshals several arguments in response. First, it
contends that IEEPA confers the power to impose tariffs be-
cause early commentators and this Court’s cases discuss
tariffs in the context of the Constitution’s Commerce
Clause. See Brief for Federal Parties 24–25; post, at 12–13
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). But that answers the wrong
question. The question is not, as the Government would
have it, whether tariffs can ever be a means of regulating
commerce. It is instead whether Congress, when conferring
the power to “regulate . . . importation,” gave the President
the power to impose tariffs at his sole discretion. And
——————
4The principal dissent surmises that the President could impose “most
if not all” of the tariffs at issue under statutes other than IEEPA. Post,
at 62 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). The cited statutes contain various com-
binations of procedural prerequisites, required agency determinations,
and limits on the duration, amount, and scope of the tariffs they author-
ize. See supra, at 8–9; post, at 62–63. We do not speculate on hypothet-
ical cases not before us.

Congress’s pattern of usage is most relevant to answering
that question. That pattern is plain: When Congress grants
the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with care-
ful constraints. It did neither here.
The Government raises another contextual argument.
Because “regulate” “lies between” two “poles” in IEEPA—
“compel” on the affirmative end and “prohibit” on the nega-
tive end—the term naturally includes the “less extreme,
more flexible” tool of tariffs. Reply Brief 9 (internal quota-
tion marks omitted); see post, at 29–30 (opinion of
KAVANAUGH, J.) (making a greater-includes-the-lesser ar-
gument). But tariffs, as discussed above, are different in
kind, not degree, from the other authorities in IEEPA. Un-
like those authorities, tariffs operate directly on domestic
importers to raise revenue for the Treasury. See 19 U. S. C.
§1505(a); 19 CFR §141.1(b) (2025). Even though a tariff is,
in some sense, “less extreme” than an outright compulsion
or prohibition, it does not follow that tariffs lie on the spec-
trum between those poles. They are instead “very clear[ly]
. . . a branch of the taxing power,” Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at
201, and fall outside the spectrum entirely.
Finding no support in the statute the President invoked,
the Government turns to one he did not: IEEPA’s predeces-
sor, TWEA. Ch. 106, 40 Stat. 411. In 1975, the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals held that the authority to
“regulate . . . importation” in TWEA authorized President
Nixon to impose limited tariffs. United States v. Yoshida
Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 572, 577–578. When Congress en-
acted IEEPA two years later, the Government contends, it
conveyed that same authority (except without the limits).
See also post, at 14–17 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).
This argument cannot bear the weight the Government
places on it. While this Court sometimes assumes that Con-
gress incorporates judicial definitions into legislation, we do
so “only when [the] term’s meaning was ‘well-settled’” be-
fore the adoption. Kemp v. United States, 596 U. S. 528,

539 (2022) (quoting Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 22
(1999)); see also United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S.
402, 412–415 (2015). A single, expressly limited opinion
from a specialized intermediate appellate court does not
clear that hurdle.5 See BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council
of Baltimore, 593 U. S. 230, 244 (2021). The tariff authority
asserted by President Nixon, moreover, was “far removed”
from TWEA’s “original purposes” of sanctioning foreign bel-
ligerents. Cohen, Fundamentals of U. S. Foreign Trade Pol-
icy, at 178–179. We are therefore skeptical that Congress
enacted IEEPA with an eye toward granting that novel
power.
The Government has another historical argument based
on this Court’s wartime precedents. See generally Brief for
Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae; Reply Brief 9–
11, 18. According to the Government, those precedents
acknowledge an inherent Presidential power to impose tar-
iffs during armed conflict. And, the argument goes, Con-
gress in TWEA, and then in IEEPA, codified those prece-
dents. But this argument fails at both steps. Insofar as the
Government relies on our wartime cases themselves, they
are facially inapposite. Regardless of what they might
mean for the President’s inherent wartime authority, all
——————
5The Government, citing the IEEPA House Committee Report, con-
tends that Congress “indisputably knew of ” Yoshida’s interpretation of
TWEA. Brief for Federal Parties 26; see also post, at 15–16, and n. 11
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). But even taking the Report at face value, it
hardly helps the Government. The Report explains that “[s]uccessive
Presidents have seized upon the open-endedness of [TWEA] section 5(b)
to turn that section, through usage, into something quite different from
what was envisioned in 1917.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–459, pp. 8–9 (1977);
accord, S. Cohen, R. Blecker, & P. Whitney, Fundamentals of U. S. For-
eign Trade Policy 178–179 (2d ed. 2003). That is not exactly a stamp of
approval on the action Yoshida guardedly endorsed. And in any event,
the Government’s “knew of ” standard falls well short of the “broad and
unquestioned” “judicial consensus” we have required to conclude that
Congress incorporated a judicial definition into a statutory term. Jama
v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349 (2005).

agree that the President has no inherent peacetime author-
ity to impose tariffs.
Nor are we persuaded that the dots connect from our war-
time precedents, through multiple iterations of TWEA, to
IEEPA, such that IEEPA should be interpreted to grant the
President an expansive peacetime tariff power. This argu-
ment relies extensively on a series of inferences drawn from
scant legislative history. Such an attenuated chain cannot
support—much less “clearly” support—a reading of IEEPA
that includes the distinct power to impose tariffs. Alabama
Assn., 594 U. S., at 764.
Turning to this Court’s precedents, the Government first
relies on Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG,
Inc., 426 U. S. 548 (1976). There, we held that Section
232(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the
President to “adjust the imports” of particular goods to pro-
tect national security, includes the power to impose “license
fees.” Id., at 561. But that holding bears little on the mean-
ing of IEEPA. As a textual matter, Section 232(b) author-
izes the President not only to “adjust . . . imports,” but (as
the Government emphasized in Algonquin) to “take such ac-
tion . . . as he deems necessary” to adjust the imports of a
good. Brief for Petitioners 26 (emphasis in original) and Tr.
of Oral Arg. 6–7, in Federal Energy Administration v. Al-
gonquin SNG, Inc., O. T. 1975, No. 75–382. IEEPA does not
contain such sweeping, discretion-conferring language. As
for context, Section 232(a) states that “[n]o action shall be
taken” to “decrease or eliminate” an existing “duty or other
import restriction” if doing so would threaten national se-
curity. 19 U. S. C. §1862(a) (1970 ed.). This explicit refer-
ence to duties preceding Section 232(b) renders it natural
for Section 232(b) itself to authorize duties. Thus, we de-
cline to extend Algonquin’s expressly “limited” holding any
further. 426 U. S., at 571.
Finally, the Government invokes Dames & Moore v. Re-
gan, 453 U. S. 654 (1981), but that case offers no support.

Dames & Moore was exceedingly narrow,6 did not address
the President’s power to “regulate,” and did not involve tar-
iffs at all. If anything, that case highlights the importance
of close attention to IEEPA’s text. “The terms of . . .
IEEPA,” we held, “do not authorize” the suspension of
claims. Id., at 675. So too here; the terms of IEEPA do not
authorize tariffs.
III
The President asserts the extraordinary power to unilat-
erally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and
scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional
context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear
congressional authorization to exercise it.
IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate . . . importation”
falls short. IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties.
The Government points to no statute in which Congress
used the word “regulate” to authorize taxation. And until
now no President has read IEEPA to confer such power.
We claim no special competence in matters of economics
or foreign affairs. We claim only, as we must, the limited
role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Ful-
filling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the
President to impose tariffs.

thousand times no,” but should have sufficed to dissuade the principal
dissent from invoking the case, see post, at 55–56, with respect to the
quite distinct legal and factual issues present here.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit in case No. 25–250 is affirmed. The

It is so ordered.
