25–250 v.
V.O.S. SELECTIONS, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not provide
the President with the power to tariff. Three of my col-
leagues have reached this result via the major questions
doctrine, see ante, at 7–13 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.)—a
framing that asks, in essence, whether Congress “would
likely have intended” to delegate the authority to tariff to
the President through IEEPA. West Virginia v. EPA, 597
U. S. 697, 730 (2022) (emphasis added); see also id., at 722–
723. While probing Congress’s intent is the right inquiry,
my colleagues speculate needlessly. In my view, the Court

can, and should, consult a statute’s legislative history to de-
termine what Congress actually intended the statute to do.
As Congress undertakes the legislative process, congres-
sional committees in the Senate and House often generate
official reports that describe Congress’s aims for the legis-
lation. See R. Katzmann, Judging Statutes 19–20 (2014)
(Katzmann). Indeed, there is evidence that lawmakers
themselves pay more attention to these reports than a stat-
ute’s text to understand the statute’s purpose and meaning.
A. Gluck & L. Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the
Inside—An Empirical Study of Congressional Drafting,
Delegation, and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901,
965–966, 968–969 (2013); see also Katzmann 37–38. Thus,
in contrast to the principal dissent’s rejection of Committee
Reports as a means of ascertaining a statute’s meaning,
post, at 16, n. 11 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.), I think these
Senate and House Reports are among the best evidence of
what Congress sought to accomplish with its enactments.
See Gluck, 65 Stan. L. Rev., at 965, 977–978, 989.
In the cases now before us, that evidence shows that Con-
gress did not intend for IEEPA to authorize the Executive
to impose tariffs. Accord, ante, at 5, n. 2 (KAGAN, J., con-
curring in part and concurring in judgment). Instead, Con-
gress intended to delegate to the President the power to
freeze and control foreign property transactions.
Four pieces of the relevant legislative record support this
conclusion. The first two are the House and Senate Reports
that accompanied the 1941 amendment to IEEPA’s prede-
cessor statute, the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA).
First enacted in 1917, TWEA authorized the President to
control foreign property during wartime. But some of
TWEA’s sections delegating this authority had lapsed, and
“there [was] doubt as to the effectiveness of other sections.”
H. R. Rep. No. 1507, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1941). Accord-
ingly, Congress amended TWEA in 1941, adding the sub-
section that includes the “regulate . . . importation”

language on which the President relies today. First War
Powers Act, 55 Stat. 839–840. The Reports explained Con-
gress’s primary purpose for the 1941 amendment: shoring
up the President’s ability to control foreign-owned property
by maintaining and strengthening the “existing system of
foreign property control (commonly known as freezing con-
trol).” H. R. Rep. No. 1507, at 2–3; see also S. Rep. No. 911,
77th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1941).1
When Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977, limiting the cir-
cumstances under which the President could exercise his
emergency authorities, it kept the “regulate . . . importa-
tion” language from TWEA. §203(a)(1)(B), 91 Stat. 1626.
The other two relevant pieces of legislative history—the
Senate and House Reports that accompanied IEEPA—
demonstrate that Congress’s intent regarding the scope of
this statutory language remained the same. As the Senate
Report explained, Congress’s sole objective for the “regulate
. . . importation” subsection was to grant the President the
emergency authority “to control or freeze property transac-
tions where a foreign interest is involved.” S. Rep. No. 95–
466, p. 5 (1977). The House Report likewise described
IEEPA as empowering the President to “regulate or freeze
any property in which any foreign country or a national
thereof has any interest.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–459, p. 15
(1977).
With this evidence of Congress’s objective, interpreting
the text of IEEPA becomes an easy task. Each of the listed
verbs—“investigate, block during the pendency of an inves-
tigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent
——————
1In addition to maintaining the President’s “freezing control” author-
ity, Congress also sought to authorize the President to seize foreign prop-
erty and use it to serve the interests of the United States. H. R. Rep.
No. 1507, at 3. To this end, the 1941 amendment provided that foreign-
owned property “shall vest . . . in such agency or person as may be desig-
nated . . . by the President.” 55 Stat. 840. Congress did not include this
vesting language in IEEPA.

or prohibit,” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B)—provides a means
by which the President can freeze or control foreign prop-
erty transactions. See ante, at 4–5, and n. 2 (opinion of
KAGAN, J.). Tariffs are different in kind. They are a tax on
imports; a means of generating revenue from transactions
between private parties. See ante, at 6 (majority opinion).
Because tariffs are not a means by which the President can
freeze or control foreign assets, interpreting IEEPA to au-
thorize tariffs would require the Court to override Con-
gress’s expressed purpose for including the “regulate . . .
importation” language in the statute.

Like THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion, the principal dissent
declines the help of legislative history. See post, at 16, n. 11
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). The dissent concludes that
IEEPA and TWEA are “best understood” as authorizing tar-
iffs, and that any other interpretation would “not make
much sense.” Post, at 24–25, 29.2 But why would it matter
which interpretation we think is “best” when Congress has
already told us? The legislative history here plainly estab-
lishes that Congress understood and intended IEEPA and
TWEA to authorize a wholly different type of power: the
power to freeze foreign-owned property. And the proper
role of the Court is to give effect to Congress’s intent, not
our own instincts. See United States v. American Trucking
Assns., Inc., 310 U. S. 534, 542 (1940).
In short, in these cases, the legislative history provides
helpful evidence of “what Congress was trying to do” in
IEEPA. Katzmann 38. Given that evidence, we need not
speculate or, worse, step into Congress’s shoes and

2This reasoning appears to follow the Court’s relatively recent practice
of picking what it deems the best reading of a statute without consider-
ation of Congress’s intent. See, e.g., Stanley v. City of Sanford, 606 U. S.
46, 51–54 (2025); accord, id., at 96–97, and n. 12 (JACKSON, J., dissent-
ing).

formulate our own views about what powers would be best
to delegate to the President for use during an emergency.
See ibid.; J. Hurst, Dealing With Statutes 33 (1982). When
Congress tells us why it has included certain language in a
statute, the limited role of the courts in our democratic sys-
tem of government—as interpreters, not lawmakers—de-
mands that we give effect to the will of the people.
