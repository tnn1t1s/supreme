This tariffs case plainly falls into the foreign affairs
category. IEEPA “directly and expressly relate[s] to foreign
affairs.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 1796.
And like quotas and embargoes, tariffs regulate the goods
that are imported into the country from foreign nations.
The tariffs do not apply to goods produced in America.
Moreover, tariffs on foreign imports are significant tools
of foreign policy and national security, whether imposed
under IEEPA, TWEA, Section 232, Section 122, Section
201, Section 301, or Section 338. They are often used to
“advance foreign policy goals, or as negotiating leverage in
trade negotiations.” Congressional Research Service, U. S.
Tariff Policy: Overview 1 (2025). Like other economic tools,
tariffs can “serve as a ‘bargaining chip’ to be used by the
President when dealing with a hostile country,” Dames &
Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 673 (1981)—or to incentivize
a change in behavior by allies, partners, or enemies. Cf.
Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 80 (opinion
of THOMAS, J.) (embargo statute “involved the external
relations of the United States”); Gundy v. United States,
588 U. S. 128, 170–171 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting).
With respect to foreign trade specifically, Congress often
“invest[s] the President with large discretion in matters
arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and
commerce with other nations.” Marshall Field & Co. v.
Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 691 (1892). Since the Founding, that
longstanding practice has included tariff statutes:
Congress has granted the President expansive power over
tariffs and foreign trade. Ante, at 13–17 (THOMAS, J.,
dissenting). And this Court has uniformly rejected
challenges to tariffs imposed by Presidents under those
statutory authorities. E.g., Federal Energy Administration
v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548, 558–560 (1976); J.
W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409
(1928); Marshall Field, 143 U. S., at 690–694; Cargo of Brig
Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382, 386–388 (1813).
As Professors Bradley and Goldsmith well summarized,
there is a “settled practice of about a century of the
executive branch exercising emergency powers in many
important contexts pursuant to the broadly worded IEEPA
and its predecessor, the Trading with the Enemy Act. And
there is an even longer practice, dating to the Founding, of
presidents exercising trade-related sanctions authority
pursuant to broadly worded statutes. Notably, the Court
has already suggested in both of these contexts that one
should expect Congress to, in effect, paint with a broad
brush.” 172 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 1796–1797.
As with tariffs on foreign imports historically, the IEEPA
tariffs on foreign imports at issue in this case implicate
foreign affairs. According to the Government, the President
has leveraged the IEEPA tariffs into trade deals with major
trading partners including China, the United Kingdom, and
Japan, among other countries. The Government says that
the tariffs have helped make certain foreign markets more
accessible to American businesses and have contributed to
trade deals with foreign nations worth trillions of dollars.
Moreover, consistent with history and the traditional
uses of tariffs, the President “is exercising his IEEPA
authority in connection with highly sensitive negotiations
he is conducting to end the conflict between the Russian
Federation and Ukraine.” Decl. of M. Rubio in No. 25–1812
(CA Fed., Aug. 29, 2025), p. 3. To that end, on August 6,
2025, the President imposed tariffs on India for “directly or
indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.” Exec. Order
No. 14329, 90 Fed. Reg. 38701 (2025). And on February 6,
2026, the President reduced the tariffs on India because,
according to the Government, India had “committed to stop
directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.”
Exec. Order No. 14384, 91 Fed. Reg. 6501 (2026).
To be sure, most foreign affairs and national security
actions—whether war, international agreements, trade
deals, or tariffs—lead to significant domestic ramifications
within the United States. And this case is no exception.
Nonetheless, in the foreign affairs field, courts interpret
statutes as written, with appropriate respect to Congress
and the President and without a major questions doctrine
weight on the scale against the President. See Youngstown,
343 U. S., at 636, n. 2 (Jackson, J., concurring).
Lest there be any remaining doubt that the major
questions doctrine does not apply to tariffs on foreign
imports, recall again this Court’s decision in Algonquin.
That case involved significant tariffs imposed by President
Ford on oil imports. The relevant statute granted the
President the authority to “adjust the imports.” 19 U. S. C.
§1862(b) (1970 ed.). The Court upheld the tariffs by
interpreting the statute as written. Neither the major
questions doctrine—nor anything resembling that
doctrine—played a role in that case.
In short, “Presidential actions pursuant to broad
congressional authorizations related to foreign affairs often
have long historical pedigrees that can in various ways
inform congressional intent to approve the actions in
question. To the extent that this is so in particular
instances, the major questions doctrine’s clear authorization
requirement does not apply.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U.
Pa. L. Rev., at 1794 (emphasis added).
So it is here: Presidents “have long been granted
substantial discretion over tariffs.” Id., at 1759, n. 90. This
Court has never before applied the major questions doctrine
to a statute authorizing the President to take action with
respect to foreign affairs in general or tariffs in particular.
And it should not do so today.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion’s reliance on the major
questions doctrine in this foreign affairs case is a first—a
novel and unprecedented use of the major questions
doctrine to invalidate Presidential action taken pursuant to
congressional authorization in the foreign affairs area. I
firmly disagree with that use of the major questions
doctrine here. In the foreign affairs context, including
tariffs, the longstanding rule is simple: Interpret the
statute as written, not with a thumb on the scale against
the President.23
