Before turning to the specifics of IEEPA’s text, history,
and precedent, I briefly review several fundamental
constitutional principles about the roles of the three
branches of the U. S. Government with respect to this case.
First, the plaintiffs and their amici, echoed by the Court,
rhetorically emphasize that Article I, Section 8, of the
Constitution assigns Congress, not the President, authority

referring to the parts of THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion that speak for only
three Justices—namely, Parts II–A–2 and III.
over tariffs. Ante, at 5. That rhetoric is a red herring in
this case because no one disputes the point. Everyone,
including the President, agrees that Congress possesses
constitutional authority over tariffs.
The important principle here, as everyone also
acknowledges, is that Congress may in turn authorize the
President to impose tariffs. Cf. FCC v. Consumers’
Research, 606 U. S. 656, 673–675 (2025); J. W. Hampton,
Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409–410 (1928).
Indeed, since the beginning of the Republic, Congress has
regularly empowered the President to order tariffs and
other foreign import restrictions under various
circumstances. As noted above, many current federal laws
continue to grant the President expansive tariff authority,
including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Section 232);
the Trade Act of 1974 (Sections 122, 201, and 301); and the
Tariff Act of 1930 (Section 338). Neither the plaintiffs nor
the Court has suggested that the numerous laws granting
tariff power to the President violate the Constitution’s
separation of powers.
Second, and relatedly, the President does not claim
unilateral authority to impose IEEPA tariffs without
congressional authorization or over a congressional
prohibition. On the contrary, the President’s argument
recognizes that, in exercising his statutory tariff power
under IEEPA, he must act within the scope of Congress’s
authorizations and abide by Congress’s limitations. And
the Executive has further acknowledged that the Judiciary
maintains the final word in justiciable cases on whether
Congress has authorized the President to impose those
tariffs under IEEPA. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 606 U. S.
831, 859–860, n. 18 (2025); cf. Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137, 177–178 (1803).
The President here contends only that Congress, by
enacting IEEPA in 1977, authorized the President to
impose tariffs on foreign imports in declared national
emergencies. To use the familiar vernacular of Justice
Robert Jackson in Youngstown, the President argues that
this case falls into category one, where the President is
acting “pursuant to an express or implied authorization of
Congress.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (concurring opinion). The President
has not here asserted authority to impose IEEPA tariffs in
a peacetime emergency in a Youngstown category two or
three scenario. Id., at 637–638.2
Third, Congress possesses a variety of tools to limit the
President’s tariffs—directly via new legislation or, perhaps
more readily, by not approving annual appropriations
necessary for the Executive Branch to continue to
implement the tariffs. See Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S.
477, 505 (2023) (“Among Congress’s most important
authorities is its control of the purse”).
Importantly, the House, the Senate, and the President
annually approve most appropriations. As a result, each
House of Congress and the President independently
possesses de facto veto power over particular
appropriations.3
Of course, many different appropriations items are
usually considered and packaged together, so the
negotiations can be complex. But the point stands:
Congress is not a helpless bystander when it comes to the
President’s exercise of tariff authority under IEEPA. Cf.
Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2011, 124 Stat. 4351–4352 (barring Executive from

2Category two applies when “the President acts in absence of either a
congressional grant or denial of authority.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at
637 (Jackson, J., concurring). Category three occurs when “the President
takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of
Congress.” Ibid.

rules, a determined minority of the Senate could block an appropriation.
Also, even over a Presidential veto, two-thirds of both Houses could
together approve certain appropriations.
using funds to transfer detainees from Guantanamo into
United States); Boland Amendment, 98 Stat. 1935–1936
(1984) (barring certain Executive Branch agencies from
providing aid to Contras in Nicaragua).
In Congress, moreover, everything is related to
everything else, as the saying goes. Members and
Committees of Congress possess substantial tools of
leverage over the Executive Branch. Cf. The Federalist No.
51, p. 322 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Congress
could, for example, wield its authority over oversight,
legislation, confirmations, or appropriations to pressure the
President to reduce or eliminate some or all of the IEEPA
tariffs.
In light of Congress’s appropriations authority and its
other robust powers, it is not correct to suggest—as THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion today elliptically does, ante, at 9—
that two-thirds majorities of both Houses of Congress would
need to pass new legislation over a Presidential veto in
order to limit these IEEPA tariffs or, more generally, to
restrict the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.
