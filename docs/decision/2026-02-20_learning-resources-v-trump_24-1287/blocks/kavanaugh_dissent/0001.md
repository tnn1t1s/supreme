APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, ET AL., PETITIONERS
25–250 v.
V.O.S. SELECTIONS, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and
JUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting.
Acting pursuant to his statutory authority to “regulate
. . . importation” under the 1977 International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, the President has imposed
tariffs on imports of foreign goods from various countries.
The tariffs have generated vigorous policy debates. Those
policy debates are not for the Federal Judiciary to resolve.
Rather, the Judiciary’s more limited role is to neutrally
interpret and apply the law. The sole legal question here is
whether, under IEEPA, tariffs are a means to “regulate . . .
importation.” Statutory text, history, and precedent
demonstrate that the answer is clearly yes: Like quotas
and embargoes, tariffs are a traditional and common tool to
regulate importation.
Since early in U. S. history, Congress has regularly
authorized the President to impose tariffs on imports of
foreign goods. Presidents have often used that authority to
obtain leverage with foreign nations, help American
manufacturers and workers compete on a more level
playing field, and generate revenue for the United States.
Numerous laws such as the Trade Expansion Act of 1962
and the Trade Act of 1974 continue to authorize the
President to place tariffs on foreign imports in a variety of
circumstances, and Presidents have often done so. In
recent years, Presidents George W. Bush, Obama, and
Biden have all imposed tariffs on foreign imports under
those statutory authorities.
President Trump has similarly imposed tariffs, and has
done so here under IEEPA. During declared national
emergencies, IEEPA broadly authorizes the President to
regulate international economic transactions. Most
relevant for this case, during those national emergencies,
IEEPA grants the President the power to “regulate . . .
importation” of foreign goods.
In early 2025, President Trump declared two national
emergencies pursuant to the National Emergencies Act.
See 50 U. S. C. §1621(a). One emergency concerned drug
trafficking into the United States. The other emergency
involved trade imbalances with foreign nations that have
harmed American manufacturers and workers.
To help address those emergencies, the President drew
upon his authority in IEEPA to “regulate . . . importation,”
and he imposed tariffs on imports from various countries.
The plaintiffs argue and the Court concludes that the
President lacks authority under IEEPA to impose tariffs. I
disagree. In accord with Judge Taranto’s careful and
persuasive opinion in the Federal Circuit, I would conclude
that the President’s power under IEEPA to “regulate . . .
importation” encompasses tariffs. As a matter of ordinary
meaning, including dictionary definitions and historical
usage, the broad power to “regulate . . . importation”
includes the traditional and common means to do so—in
particular, quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.
History and precedent confirm that conclusion. In 1971,
President Nixon imposed 10 percent tariffs on almost all
foreign imports. He levied the tariffs under IEEPA’s
predecessor statute, the Trading with the Enemy Act,
which similarly authorized the President to “regulate
. . . importation.” The Nixon tariffs were upheld in court.
Moreover, in 1976, a year before IEEPA was enacted, this
Court unanimously ruled that a similarly worded statute
authorizing the President to “adjust the imports” permitted
President Ford to impose monetary exactions on foreign oil
imports. See Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin
SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548 (1976) (Algonquin).
For both the Nixon tariffs and the Ford tariffs upheld by
this Court in Algonquin, the relevant statutory provisions
did not specifically refer to “tariffs” or “duties,” but instead
more broadly authorized the President to “regulate . . .
importation” or to “adjust the imports.” Therefore, when
IEEPA was enacted in 1977 in the wake of the Nixon and
Ford tariffs and the Algonquin decision, Congress and the
public plainly would have understood that the power to
“regulate . . . importation” included tariffs. If Congress
wanted to exclude tariffs from IEEPA, it surely would not
have enacted the same broad “regulate . . . importation”
language that had just been used to justify major American
tariffs on foreign imports.
Importantly, IEEPA’s authorization for the President to
impose tariffs did not grant the President any new
substantive power. Since the Founding, numerous statutes
have authorized—and still do authorize—the President to
impose tariffs and other foreign import restrictions. IEEPA
merely allows the President to impose tariffs somewhat
more efficiently to deal with foreign threats during national
emergencies.
Context and common sense buttress that interpretation
of IEEPA. The plaintiffs and the Court acknowledge that
IEEPA authorizes the President to impose quotas or
embargoes on foreign imports—meaning that a President
could completely block some or all imports. But they say
that IEEPA does not authorize the President to employ the
lesser power of tariffs, which simply condition imports on a
payment. As they interpret the statute, the President
could, for example, block all imports from China but cannot
order even a $1 tariff on goods imported from China.
That approach does not make much sense. Properly read,
IEEPA does not draw such an odd distinction between
quotas and embargoes on the one hand and tariffs on the
other. Rather, it empowers the President to regulate
imports during national emergencies with the tools
Presidents have traditionally and commonly used,
including quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.
The Court today nonetheless concludes otherwise and
holds that IEEPA does not authorize the President to
impose tariffs to deal with the declared drug trafficking and
trade deficit emergencies. But the Court’s decision is
splintered. In today’s six-Justice majority, three Justices
(JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE
JACKSON) interpret IEEPA not to authorize tariffs as a
matter of ordinary statutory interpretation. I disagree for
the reasons noted above and elaborated on at length in this
opinion.
Three other Justices (THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE
GORSUCH, and JUSTICE BARRETT) lean on the major
questions canon of statutory interpretation to resolve this
case. That important canon requires “clear congressional
authorization” for an executive action of major economic
and political significance, particularly when the Executive
exercises an “unheralded” power. West Virginia v. EPA,
597 U. S. 697, 722–723 (2022) (quotation marks omitted).
In my view, as I will explain, the major questions canon
does not control here for two alternative and independent
reasons.
First, the statutory text, history, and precedent
constitute “clear congressional authorization” for the
President to impose tariffs under IEEPA. In particular,
throughout American history, Presidents have commonly
imposed tariffs as a means to “regulate . . . importation.” So
tariffs were not an “unheralded” power when Congress
enacted IEEPA in 1977 and authorized the President to
“regulate . . . importation” of foreign goods. Therefore, the
major questions doctrine is satisfied here. Cf. Biden v.
Missouri, 595 U. S. 87 (2022) (per curiam).
Second, in any event, the Court has never before applied
the major questions doctrine in the foreign affairs context,
including foreign trade. Rather, as Justice Robert Jackson
summarized and remains true, this Court has always
recognized the “‘unwisdom of requiring Congress in this
field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite
standards by which the President is to be governed.’”
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636,
n. 2 (1952) (concurring opinion) (quoting United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 321–322
(1936)). In foreign affairs cases, courts read the statute as
written and do not employ the major questions doctrine as
a thumb on the scale against the President.
Although I firmly disagree with the Court’s holding
today, the decision might not substantially constrain a
President’s ability to order tariffs going forward. That is
because numerous other federal statutes authorize the
President to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not
all) of the tariffs at issue in this case—albeit perhaps with
a few additional procedural steps that IEEPA, as an
emergency statute, does not require. Those statutes
include, for example, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962
(Section 232); the Trade Act of 1974 (Sections 122, 201, and
301); and the Tariff Act of 1930 (Section 338). In essence,
the Court today concludes that the President checked the
wrong statutory box by relying on IEEPA rather than
another statute to impose these tariffs.
In the meantime, however, the interim effects of the
Court’s decision could be substantial. The United States
may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers
who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers
may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.
As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process
is likely to be a “mess.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 153–155. In
addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs
have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of
dollars—including with foreign nations from China to the
United Kingdom to Japan, and more. The Court’s decision
could generate uncertainty regarding those trade
arrangements.
In any event, the only issue before the Court today is one
of law. In light of the statutory text, longstanding historical
practice, and relevant Supreme Court precedents, I would
conclude that IEEPA authorizes the President to “regulate
. . . importation” by imposing tariffs on foreign imports
during declared national emergencies. I therefore
respectfully dissent.1
