Related precedent further demonstrates that the major
questions doctrine has not traditionally applied in the
national security or foreign policy contexts. Consider two
prominent examples.
First, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507, this Court
considered the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military
Force, which Congress passed and President George W.
Bush signed on September 18, 2001, in the wake of the al
Qaeda attacks on the United States. The law broadly
——————
23 In his thoughtful concurrence, JUSTICE GORSUCH agrees that the
major questions doctrine often does not apply to foreign affairs statutes,
but in his view it does not apply only when the President also has
inherent or independent Article II power. Ante, at 30–31. THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s opinion for three Justices also gestures at that position. See
ante, at 12–13. I see some analytical and practical problems with that
approach.
First, as JUSTICE GORSUCH elsewhere notes, the major questions
doctrine serves in part to reinforce nondelegation principles. Yet as I
have explained, the Court’s nondelegation cases from the Founding to
the present—including numerous cases involving tariffs—have
“recognized internal and external affairs as being in separate categories,
and held that the strict limitation upon congressional delegations of
power to the President over internal affairs does not apply with respect
to delegations of power in external affairs.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636, n. 2 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring);
see also United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304,
319–322 (1936); Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 422 (1935).
In those cases, the Court has not further subdivided the foreign affairs
power in the manner that JUSTICE GORSUCH now suggests.
Second, terms such as “inherent” or “independent” in this context
continue to be “used, often interchangeably and without fixed or
ascertainable meanings.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 647 (Jackson, J.,
concurring); see also id., at 637. So it would be both novel and
jurisprudentially chaotic to try to now create a new approach tying the
applicability of the major questions canon in the foreign affairs context
to such uncertain triggers.
empowered the President to use “all necessary and
appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or
persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or
aided the terrorist attacks” that occurred on September 11,
2001. Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115 Stat. 224
(Sept. 18, 2001).
In Hamdi, the Government militarily detained in the
United States an American citizen who had taken up arms
with the Taliban. 542 U. S., at 510–511. The plaintiff
Hamdi argued, among other things, that the AUMF
generally authorized the use of force but did not specifically
authorize military detention, at least detention of
American-citizen enemy combatants in the United States.
See id., at 515–517. He contended that his military
detention was therefore illegal.
In the principal opinion by Justice O’Connor, the Court
rejected Hamdi’s statutory argument, explaining that it
was “of no moment that the AUMF does not use specific
language of detention.” Id., at 519. Rather, because
“detention to prevent a combatant’s return to the battlefield
is a fundamental incident of waging war, in permitting the
use of ‘necessary and appropriate force,’ Congress has
clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the
narrow circumstances considered here.” Ibid.
Consider the similarities between Hamdi and this case.
Both involve major questions of foreign affairs. Hamdi
involved U. S. military detention of an American citizen in
America, pursuant to a generally worded authorization for
use of military force. This case involves tariffs on foreign
goods imported into America pursuant to a generally
worded authorization to regulate importation. Detention is
a traditional incident of the President’s delegated power to
wage war. See id., at 518. Tariffs are a traditional incident
of the President’s delegated power to regulate imports and
foreign commerce. In Hamdi, the Court said that as a
matter of history, practice, and precedent, the AUMF’s
general authorization for the use of military force clearly
encompassed detention of enemy combatants. Id., at 518–
522. Here, as a matter of history, practice, and precedent,
IEEPA’s general authorization for regulation of
importation likewise clearly encompasses tariffs on foreign
imports.
Second, in 1981 in Dames & Moore, 453 U. S. 654, the
Court did not apply the major questions doctrine, even
though the Court had recently applied that principle in a
significant domestic policy case. Cf. Industrial Union Dept.,
AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607
(1980) (plurality opinion).
The Dames & Moore case arose in the wake of the Iran
hostage crisis where Iran held more than 50 American
hostages at the U. S. Embassy in Iran for more than 14
months. As one part of the ultimate settlement of the
hostage crisis with Iran, President Reagan suspended
claims by U. S. nationals against Iran that were pending in
American courts. Dames & Moore, 453 U. S., at 666. The
President did so under IEEPA and the Hostage Act. Id., at
675.
There can be little doubt that the question of suspending
American citizens’ claims against Iran was one of major
economic and political significance. And the Court further
recognized that the case touched “fundamentally upon the
manner in which our Republic is to be governed.” Id., at
659. Yet the Court did not require “clear congressional
authorization” for the President’s exercise of that authority
to suspend the Americans’ claims against Iran.
On the contrary, the Court openly acknowledged that the
relevant statutes—IEEPA and the Hostage Act—did not
provide clear or “specific authorization” for the President to
suspend those claims. Id., at 677. The Court nonetheless
concluded that the “general tenor of Congress’ legislation in
this area”—combined with Congress’s longstanding
acquiescence to the President’s practice of settling claims—
supported the President’s suspension of those claims. Id.,
at 678. Congress’s “general tenor” and acquiescence are of
course far less than the “clear congressional authorization”
that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion today newly demands for
the President’s tariffs.
Again, consider the similarities between Dames & Moore
and this case. Dames & Moore involved complicated
questions of foreign policy and national security. The
statutes in Dames & Moore were generally worded and did
not specifically authorize suspension of claims. But
Presidents had historically exercised a similar power. See
id., at 677–682. Here, we likewise have a generally worded
statutory authorization to “regulate . . . importation.” And
Presidents have historically imposed tariffs.
If IEEPA permitted the President to lawfully suspend
claims in Dames & Moore—despite the Court’s transparent
acknowledgment that the actual statutory text did not
clearly authorize the President’s actions—then surely
IEEPA’s authorization to “regulate . . . importation” easily
justifies these tariffs.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion would chart a new course
for the major questions doctrine, extending it for the first
time deep into the foreign affairs sphere. If the Court had
applied the major questions doctrine in Hamdi and Dames
& Moore, those two landmark cases almost certainly would
have been decided differently. So today’s opinion marks a
significant change. Will the Court apply the major
questions doctrine in the foreign affairs context again in the
future? Or is this a ticket good for one day and one train
only? Time will tell. But in the meantime, the decision
could engender significant uncertainty over the Executive’s
exercise of statutory authority in the foreign affairs realm.
As the Hamdi and Dames & Moore examples
demonstrate, applying the major questions doctrine in the
foreign policy and national security contexts in the past
would have seriously hindered the President’s ability to
exercise power granted by Congress to achieve important
foreign policy and national security objectives for America.
And if applied in the foreign affairs context in the future, it
could impair Presidents’ vital statutory authorities with
respect to foreign policy and national security.24
* * *
Having said all of that on foreign affairs, I reiterate that
the major questions doctrine—even if it applies in this
foreign affairs context—does not defeat major executive
actions that are clearly authorized by Congress. See
Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 1790–1791.
And as explained in Part III–A above, in IEEPA Congress
clearly authorized the President to impose tariffs to
“regulate . . . importation” in national emergencies. In
other words, even if the major questions doctrine applies in
the foreign affairs context exactly as it does in domestic
affairs, the President should still prevail in this case.
