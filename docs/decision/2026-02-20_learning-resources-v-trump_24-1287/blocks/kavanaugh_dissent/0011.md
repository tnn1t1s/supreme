Second, there is an alternative and independent reason
why the major questions doctrine does not apply here: This
is a foreign affairs case.
A plethora of statutes in the U. S. Code grant the
Executive the power to act in foreign affairs. And most of
the important actions that “presidents take today,
including in foreign affairs, rest at least in part on statutory
——————
21Taken at face value, moreover, the Court’s major questions analysis
would presumably also preclude Presidents from imposing quotas under
IEEPA. Quotas are justified under the same “regulate . . . importation”
language. How could the Court distinguish quotas from tariffs for major
questions purposes? After all, quotas can be of even greater economic
and political significance than tariffs.
22 In his concurrence, JUSTICE GORSUCH opines that the phrase
“monetary exactions on foreign imports” would constitute clear
congressional authorization, but that the phrase “regulate . . .
importation” does not. Ante, at 30. But if the phrase “regulate . . .
importation” has historically and commonly encompassed “monetary
exactions on foreign imports”—as it has—and if the four major questions
factors taken together support the Executive—as they do—then I cannot
agree with the line that JUSTICE GORSUCH is drawing between those two
formulations.
authorization.” C. Bradley & J. Goldsmith, Foreign Affairs,
Nondelegation, and the Major Questions Doctrine, 172 U.
Pa. L. Rev. 1743, 1745 (2024).
Yet this Court has never before applied the major
questions doctrine—or anything resembling it—to a foreign
affairs statute. I would not make this case the first.
Rather, in the foreign affairs context, this Court has
interpreted statutes as written, with respect for the
primacy of Congress’s and the President’s roles in foreign
affairs and without using the major questions doctrine as a
thumb on the scale against the President. See, e.g.,
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 529–530 (1988).
That deeply rooted textualist approach to interpreting
foreign affairs statutes is nothing new. What is new and
rather extraordinary is the approach embodied in THE
CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion for three Justices, which would
extend the major questions doctrine into the foreign affairs
realm for the first time.
Recall that the major questions doctrine is based on two
overlapping foundations: “separation of powers principles
and a practical understanding of legislative intent.” West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723.
With respect to separation of powers, the major questions
doctrine serves to reinforce the nondelegation doctrine. But
in the foreign affairs realm, the Court has recognized that
Congress often broadly delegates authority to the
Executive. From the Founding, numerous foreign affairs
statutes “authorizing action by the President in respect of
subjects affecting foreign relations” either “leave the
exercise of the power to his unrestricted judgment, or
provide a standard far more general than that which has
always been considered requisite with regard to domestic
affairs.” United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299
U. S. 304, 324 (1936); Department of Transportation v.
Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S. 43, 80, n. 5
(2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). The reason
for those broad delegations is simple and obvious: If
“success” for America’s foreign affairs “aims” is to be
“achieved, congressional legislation . . . must often accord to
the President a degree of discretion and freedom from
statutory restriction which would not be admissible were
domestic affairs alone involved.” Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S.,
at 320. Stated otherwise, “Congress—in giving the
Executive authority over matters of foreign affairs—must
of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it
customarily wields in domestic areas.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U. S. 1, 17 (1965).
As Justice Robert Jackson summarized, the Court’s
nondelegation cases—consistent with the “unbroken
legislative practice which has prevailed almost from the
inception of the national government,” Curtiss-Wright, 299
U. S., at 322—have “recognized internal and external
affairs as being in separate categories, and held that the
strict limitation upon congressional delegations of power to
the President over internal affairs does not apply with
respect to delegations of power in external affairs.”
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636,
n. 2 (1952) (concurring opinion); see Curtiss-Wright, 299
U. S., at 319–322; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S.
388, 422 (1935).
As Justice Jackson further noted, the Court’s precedents
recognize the “‘unwisdom of requiring Congress in this field
of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite
standards by which the President is to be governed.’”
Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 636, n. 2 (concurring opinion)
(quoting Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 321–322).
If the major questions doctrine is designed in part to
protect nondelegation principles, but the nondelegation
doctrine does not play a substantial role in foreign affairs
cases (as the Court has held), then it follows that courts
should not employ the major questions doctrine to put a
thumb on the scale against the President when interpreting
foreign affairs statutes. Rather, as Justice Robert Jackson
stated, courts should interpret those statutes as written.
Relatedly, to the extent that the major questions doctrine
is designed to reflect a “practical understanding of
legislative intent,” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723, the
doctrine appropriately plays no role in “national security or
foreign policy contexts, because the canon does not reflect
ordinary congressional intent in those areas.” FCC v.
Consumers’ Research, 606 U. S. 656, 706 (2025)
(KAVANAUGH, J., concurring). In the foreign affairs realm,
Congress “has good reason to—and intends to—authorize
many executive branch actions related to foreign affairs in
broad or general terms.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa.
L. Rev., at 1793.
Congress ordinarily seeks “to give the President
substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and
the American people.” Consumers’ Research, 606 U. S., at
706–707 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring). After all, the
President exercises the “vast share of responsibility for the
conduct of our foreign relations.” American Ins. Assn. v.
Garamendi, 539 U. S. 396, 414 (2003) (quotation marks
omitted). So Congress “often” gives the President “a degree
of discretion.” Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 320. That
“unbroken legislative practice” from the Founding means
that courts interpreting statutes in the foreign affairs field
should assume that Congress meant what it said. Id., at
322.
Stated otherwise, “if the major questions doctrine turns
on a contextual inquiry into likely congressional intent, it
is likely for a variety of reasons to have less purchase in the
foreign affairs area.” Bradley & Goldsmith, 172 U. Pa. L.
Rev., at 1790.
To be clear, Congress of course maintains the ultimate
power over how broadly or narrowly to write statutes in the
foreign policy and national security contexts. For example,
Congress can write foreign affairs statutes narrowly.
Indeed, even for wartime powers, Congress rarely gives the
President a “blank check.” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S.
507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion). And when Congress
writes a narrow foreign affairs statute, this Court has
enforced those statutory limits as written. Cf. Hamdan v.
Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 593–595 (2006); id., at 638–639
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part).
Moreover, when it does legislate more broadly, Congress
sometimes claws back the statutory authorization by
rescinding or amending overbroad statutes, or by
restricting previously granted Presidential power through
the leverage it possesses over appropriations, new
legislation, or confirmations. See, e.g., Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 1783; Military
Commissions Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 2600, as amended, 10
U. S. C. §948a et seq.; Case-Church Amendment, Pub. L.
93–50, §307, 87 Stat. 129. Either House of Congress alone,
through the appropriations process, can insist on certain
limits as a condition of approving funding. At the end of the
day, given the appropriations power, Congress holds the
cards.
In short, in the foreign affairs context, this Court has
never before super-imposed the major questions doctrine (or
any similar canon or principle) onto ordinary statutory
interpretation to place a thumb on the scale against the
President. Rather, the Court interprets the relevant
statutes according to their text, with respect for Congress’s
and the President’s central roles in the foreign policy and
national security fields.
