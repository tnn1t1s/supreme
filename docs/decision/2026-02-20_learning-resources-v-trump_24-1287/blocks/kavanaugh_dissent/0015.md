The overarching theme of the Court’s opinion is that
tariffs are not a clear means to “regulate . . . importation”
and that Congress was therefore required to use the word
“tariff,” “duty,” or the like in IEEPA in 1977 if it wanted to
authorize tariffs on foreign imports. But that conclusion
——————
25Some last points for completeness: The plaintiffs also raise two other
arguments that the Court today does not address or rely on. First, they
argue that Section 122, a non-emergency tariff statute that addresses
trade deficits, implicitly displaces IEEPA’s tariff authority. Second, they
argue that the tariffs here do not deal with an “unusual and
extraordinary threat” as to which a national emergency has been
declared. In my view, those arguments are insubstantial, as Judge
Taranto persuasively explained in the Federal Circuit. See 149 F. 4th
1312, 1359–1361, 1371–1375 (2025) (dissenting opinion). Because the
Court today does not address or rely on them, I will not discuss them
further here. Finally, I agree with footnote 1 of the Court’s opinion
regarding jurisdiction. Ante, at 5, n. 1.
contravenes text, history, and precedent. To summarize:
Algonquin in 1976 unanimously held the opposite. The
Nixon and Ford tariffs were based on statutory provisions
that did not use the word “tariff ” or “duty.” There is a long
tradition of Presidents imposing tariffs as a means of
regulating importation and commerce. The predecessor
Trading with the Enemy Act has long been understood to
authorize tariffs during wartime as a means to “regulate . . .
importation,” even though it does not use the word “tariff ”
or “duty.” The history of the Polk, Lincoln, and McKinley
tariffs shows that tariffs are a means of regulating
importation. Marshall, Story, and Madison stated that
tariffs are a means of regulating foreign commerce. The
dictionary definitions and ordinary usage establish that
tariffs are a means of regulating importation.
All of that and much more, in my view, overwhelmingly
establish that IEEPA clearly authorizes the President to
impose tariffs.
That said, with respect to tariffs in particular, the Court’s
decision might not prevent Presidents from imposing most
if not all of these same sorts of tariffs under other statutory
authorities. For example, Section 122 of the Trade Act of
1974 permits the President to impose a “temporary import
surcharge” to “deal with large and serious United States
balance-of-payments deficits.” 19 U. S. C. §2132(a).
Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides that, if the
International Trade Commission determines an article is
being imported in such quantities that it is “a substantial
cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the
domestic industry producing an article like or directly
competitive with the imported article,” the President may
take “appropriate and feasible action,” including imposing
a “duty.” §§2251(a), 2253(a)(3)(A). Section 301 of the Trade
Act of 1974 authorizes the President through a subordinate
officer to “impose duties” if he determines that “an act,
policy, or practice of a foreign country” is “unjustifiable and
burdens or restricts United States commerce.” §§2411(a)–
(c). Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 permits the
President to impose tariffs when he finds that “any foreign
country places any burden or disadvantage upon the
commerce of the United States.” §1338(d). And Section 232
of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 authorizes the
President to, after receiving a report from the Secretary of
Commerce, “adjust the imports of [an] article and its
derivatives so that such imports will not threaten to impair
the national security.” §1862(c)(1)(a).
So the Court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict
Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court’s
decision is likely to generate other serious practical
consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds.
Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant
consequences for the U. S. Treasury. The Court says
nothing today about whether, and if so how, the
Government should go about returning the billions of
dollars that it has collected from importers. But that
process is likely to be a “mess,” as was acknowledged at oral
argument. Tr. of Oral Arg. 153–155. A second issue is the
decision’s effect on the current trade deals. Because IEEPA
tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of
dollars—including with foreign nations from China to the
United Kingdom to Japan, the Court’s decision could
generate uncertainty regarding various trade agreements.
That process, too, could be difficult.

The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy.
But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are
clearly lawful. I respectfully dissent.
