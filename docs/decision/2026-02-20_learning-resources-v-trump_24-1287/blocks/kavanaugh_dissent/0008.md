In an ordinary statutory interpretation case, I am
confident that a majority of this Court would flatly reject
the plaintiffs’ exceedingly weak statutory arguments and
would hold that IEEPA’s authorization for the President to
“regulate . . . importation” during national emergencies
includes the power to impose tariffs.
Notably, the Court today does not claim that the phrase
“regulate . . . importation” on its own excludes tariffs as a
matter of ordinary statutory meaning. Only three Members
of the Court, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and
JUSTICE JACKSON, do so.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion in Part II–A–2, which is
joined only by JUSTICE GORSUCH and JUSTICE BARRETT,
instead relies on the major questions doctrine. The major
questions doctrine is an important canon of statutory
interpretation that the Court has applied in a number of
significant cases over the last 45 years. See Industrial
Union Dept., AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum Institute,
448 U. S. 607, 645 (1980) (plurality opinion).
Justice Scalia articulated the canonical statement of the
major questions doctrine: “We expect Congress to speak
clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast
‘economic and political significance.’” Utility Air
Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 324 (2014)
(quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529
U. S. 120, 160 (2000)); see also Alabama Assn. of Realtors
v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. 758,
764 (2021) (per curiam); National Federation of
Independent Business v. OSHA, 595 U. S. 109, 117 (2022)
(per curiam); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 507 (2023);
cf. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (2022).
Stated otherwise, in cases where the Executive Branch
takes an action of major economic and political significance,
it must “point to ‘clear congressional authorization’ for the
power it claims.” Ibid. (quoting Utility Air, 573 U. S., at
324).
The requirement of “clear congressional authorization”
for executive actions of major economic and political
significance is “grounded in two overlapping and
reinforcing presumptions: (i) a separation of powers-based
presumption against the delegation of major lawmaking
authority from Congress to the Executive Branch, and (ii) a
presumption that Congress intends to make major policy
decisions itself, not leave those decisions to agencies.”
United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC, 855 F. 3d 381, 419
(CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of
rehearing en banc) (citation omitted). As this Court later
recounted in West Virginia, “both separation of powers
principles and a practical understanding of legislative
intent make us reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory
text the delegation claimed to be lurking there.” 597 U. S.,
at 723 (quotation marks omitted).15 The doctrine guards
“against unintentional, oblique, or otherwise unlikely
delegations of the legislative power.” NFIB, 595 U. S., at
125 ().16
I agree that this case involves an executive action of
major economic and political significance—which is
typically the trigger for requiring “clear congressional
authorization.” But in my respectful view, THE CHIEF
JUSTICE’s opinion’s application of the major questions
doctrine in this case is incorrect for two alternative and
independent reasons. First, the statutory text, history, and
precedent constitute “clear congressional authorization” for
the President to impose tariffs as a means to “regulate . . .
importation.” Second, and in the alternative, the major
questions doctrine does not apply in the foreign affairs
context. In the foreign affairs realm, courts recognize that
Congress often deliberately grants flexibility and discretion
to the President to pursue America’s interests. In that
context, courts therefore engage in “routine” textualist
statutory interpretation—reading the text as written—and
do not employ the major questions doctrine as a thumb on
the scale against the President. West Virginia, 597 U. S.,
at 724.

15The major questions doctrine has also been analogized to, among
other things, the mischief rule, the absurdity doctrine, common sense,
and context. See, e.g., S. Bray, The Mischief Rule, 109 Geo. L. J. 967,
1011 (2021) (doctrine “has an essential similarity with the mischief
rule”); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 511 (2023) (BARRETT, J.,
concurring) (context, common sense).
16I have long been, and fully remain, a strong proponent of the major
questions doctrine. See United States Telecom, 855 F. 3d, at 418–426
(opinion of Kavanaugh, J.); Loving v. IRS, 742 F. 3d 1013, 1021 (CADC
2014); Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, No. 9–1322
(CADC, Dec. 20, 2012), pp. 9–10 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial
of rehearing en banc).
