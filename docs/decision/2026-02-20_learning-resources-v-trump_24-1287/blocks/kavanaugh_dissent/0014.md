Finally, no Member of the Court today relies on the
nondelegation doctrine. But the plaintiffs briefly raise such
an argument, and I will therefore briefly address it. The
——————
24What is the status going forward of the major questions doctrine in
foreign affairs cases? Only three Justices (at most) today suggest that
the major questions doctrine should apply in the foreign affairs context—
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE GORSUCH, and JUSTICE BARRETT. I doubt
that the major questions doctrine analysis in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
opinion for those three Justices is controlling for future cases as a matter
of precedent under the Marks rule. See Marks v. United States, 430 U. S.
188, 193 (1977). That is because three Justices (JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR,
JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE JACKSON) do not recognize the major
questions doctrine at all. Ante, at 1–2 (KAGAN, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). And this dissent would not apply it in the
foreign affairs context. So it appears that six Justices would not apply it
in the foreign affairs context. In my view, the question of whether or how
the major questions doctrine applies in foreign affairs cases remains at
least an open question.
argument is unavailing for many of the reasons already
noted in the major questions analysis above. This Court
has repeatedly rejected constitutional challenges to
congressional delegations to the President in the foreign
affairs area, including delegations of tariff authority.
For matters of foreign affairs and national security, the
Court has traditionally recognized that Congress “must of
necessity paint with a brush broader than that it
customarily wields in domestic areas.” Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U. S. 1, 17 (1965). And to reiterate, numerous statutes
“‘authorizing action by the President in respect of subjects
affecting foreign relations’” “‘either leave the exercise of the
power to his unrestricted judgment, or provide a standard
far more general than that which has always been
considered requisite with regard to domestic affairs.’”
Department of Transportation v. Association of American
Railroads, 575 U. S. 43, 80, n. 5 (2015) (THOMAS, J.,
concurring in judgment) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-
Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 324 (1936)). Therefore,
as JUSTICE THOMAS has explained, the Court’s precedents
establish that “the Constitution grants the President a
greater measure of discretion in the realm of foreign
relations.” Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at
80, n. 5; see Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at 319–
322; Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 422
(1935).
Justice Robert Jackson likewise noted the “‘unwisdom of
requiring Congress in this field of governmental power to
lay down narrowly definite standards by which the
President is to be governed.’” Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 636, n. 2 (1952) (concurring
opinion) (quoting Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 321–322).
As such, the “strict limitation upon congressional
delegations of power to the President over internal affairs
does not apply with respect to delegations of power in
external affairs.” Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 636, n. 2
(concurring opinion).
Because statutes that “involv[e] the external relations of
the United States” do not trigger the same kind of
delegation concerns as purely domestic ones, Association of
American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 80 (opinion of THOMAS,
J.), the Court has regularly upheld delegations of power to
the President in the national security and foreign policy
realms. See, e.g., Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 319–322;
Loving v. United States, 517 U. S. 748, 771–774 (1996).
Indeed, if a strict nondelegation doctrine applied in those
areas, numerous statutes—including many authorizations
for use of military force in the Nation’s history—would have
been unconstitutional delegations of authority to the
President. See Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115
Stat. 224 (Sept. 18, 2001) (“[T]he President is authorized to
use all necessary and appropriate force against those
nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned,
authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that
occurred on September 11, 2001”).
As to tariffs in particular: Broad delegations of tariff
authority to the President have been in the heartland of
permissible delegations upheld by this Court. Congress
may, without running afoul of the Constitution, “invest the
President with large discretion in matters arising out of the
execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with
other nations.” Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S.
649, 691 (1892). Congressional delegations of tariffs and
other foreign trade authorities to the President date back
to near the Founding. And this Court has uniformly
rejected nondelegation challenges to statutes delegating
that authority to the President. E.g., Federal Energy
Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548, 558–
560 (1976); J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276
U. S. 394, 409 (1928); Marshall Field, 143 U. S., at 690–694;
Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch 382, 386–
388 (1813).
This Court’s decision in Algonquin is again instructive.
There, the Court held that Section 232 did not constitute an
unconstitutional delegation. 426 U. S., at 558–560. The
Court found it sufficient that the President could act “only”
to the extent “he deems necessary to adjust the imports” of
an article such that it “will not threaten to impair the
national security.” Id., at 559 (quotation marks omitted).
To be clear, I am not suggesting that there is no
nondelegation doctrine in the foreign affairs realm. But the
Court has consistently recognized that the doctrine affords
more flexibility to Congress and the President in that area
to deal with the complex foreign relations issues and
national security threats facing America. See Association
of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 80, n. 5 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.); Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 636, n. 2 (Jackson,
J., concurring); Curtiss-Wright, 299 U. S., at 319–322;
Panama Refining, 293 U. S., at 422.
In all events, for purposes of this Court’s nondelegation
precedents, IEEPA sufficiently constrains the President’s
authority to declare an emergency and impose tariffs. See
J. W. Hampton, 276 U. S., at 409; FCC v. Consumers’
Research, 606 U. S. 656, 673–675, 681–691 (2025). The
President may exercise the authorities in IEEPA “only” “to
deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat” that “has
its source in whole or substantial part outside the United
States” and “with respect to which a national emergency
has been declared.” 50 U. S. C. §1701. Congress placed
numerous limits on IEEPA, including a default 1-year time
limit, an enumerated list of exceptions, and comprehensive
congressional reporting requirements. See §§1622(d),
1702(b), 1703.
It is also useful to underscore the extraordinary nature of
the plaintiffs’ nondelegation argument here. The plaintiffs’
submission would mean that these tariffs would be
unlawful even if IEEPA explicitly authorized tariffs. Unlike
their statutory and major questions doctrine arguments,
their nondelegation argument is not based on a lack of an
explicit reference to “tariffs” or “duties” or the like. Their
nondelegation argument instead goes much further and
would require very specific congressional directions to the
President on when and under what circumstances he could
impose tariffs and how high those tariffs could be. The
plaintiffs’ theory would have dramatic consequences and
likely wipe out many of the existing tariff statutes that have
long been upheld by this Court, as well as TWEA. And if
the tariff authority here is unlawful, so too are most if not
all IEEPA authorities such as asset freezes, embargoes, and
quotas. And it would not stop there. The plaintiffs’
nondelegation theory would threaten various other
national security and foreign affairs statutes that similarly
grant substantial discretion to the President. The Court
today thankfully does not go down that road.25
