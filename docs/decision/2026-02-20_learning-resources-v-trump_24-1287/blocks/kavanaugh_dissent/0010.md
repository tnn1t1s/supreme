So in this case we must apply those four factors in order
to determine whether Congress, when it afforded the
President the power to “regulate . . . importation,” clearly
authorized the President to impose tariffs. As I see it, those
factors show that Congress clearly authorized tariffs in
IEEPA when it empowered the President to “regulate . . .
importation.”
First, unlike the OSHA vaccine mandate in NFIB or the
greenhouse gas regulation in Utility Air, for example, the
President here is not exercising an “unheralded” or
“newfound authority” based on a “long-extant” statute—
that is, exercising a power that was unanticipated or
unforeseen when Congress enacted IEEPA’s “regulate . . .
importation” language in 1977.
On the contrary, as was fully explained above, the tariff
authority exercised here is not remotely “unheralded.” To
recap: Any citizen or Member of Congress who paid the
least bit of attention in 1977 would have readily understood
that the President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation”
encompassed the power to tariff. There are the dictionary
definitions and the historical usage and practice. And
among other things, just a few years before IEEPA, that
“regulate . . . importation” language was invoked by
President Nixon and judicially approved to sustain his 10
percent worldwide tariffs. President Ford then
implemented significant tariffs using substantially similar
“adjust the imports” statutory language, and this Court
unanimously upheld President Ford’s tariffs in Algonquin.
So IEEPA’s grant of authority to the President to impose
tariffs in order to regulate importation is not “unheralded”
or “newfound.” That authority was plain as day in 1977.19
——————
19The Court downplays the significance of the prominent Nixon and
Ford tariffs. Ante, at 17–19 (majority opinion); ante, at 27–28, 39
(). But the Nixon and Ford examples, as well as
Algonquin, are critical for a proper and full understanding of the
meaning of “regulate . . . importation” when Congress enacted IEEPA in
1977. We cannot ignore or diminish that history. THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
opinion and JUSTICE GORSUCH’s concurrence also say that no President
since 1977 has invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs. Ante, at 10 (opinion of
ROBERTS, C. J.); ante, at 27–28 (). But since
Second, the President is not interpreting the “regulate . . .
importation” language in IEEPA differently from how past
Presidents have interpreted it. At least as far as the
briefing and arguments in this case have disclosed, no
Presidential Administration since the enactment of the
“regulate . . . importation” language in TWEA in 1941 or
since its re-enactment in IEEPA in 1977 has interpreted
the statute to exclude the power to impose tariffs.
Moreover, before IEEPA’s enactment, President Nixon
imposed tariffs based on the same “regulate . . .
importation” language. And in 1975, President Ford
invoked authority to “adjust the imports” in order to
similarly impose monetary exactions. In addition—if more
is needed—Marshall, Story, Madison, and this Court have
all long recognized that the power to regulate foreign
commerce includes tariffs.
The current President’s reading of IEEPA follows from
and is entirely consistent with those past interpretations—
making his position nothing like, for example, FDA’s when
it changed its longstanding position that it lacked the
authority to regulate cigarettes, Brown & Williamson, 529
U. S., at 159–160, or OSHA’s when it implemented a
vaccine requirement even though it had “never before
adopted a broad public health regulation of this kind,”
NFIB, 595 U. S., at 119.
When, as here, “established practice,” West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 725 (quotation marks omitted), and the Executive’s
“track record,” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 519
——————
1977, Presidents have imposed numerous tariffs under non-emergency
tariff statutes—including Section 232, which like IEEPA also does not
explicitly reference tariffs or taxes. The fact that recent Presidents have
not often had occasion under the National Emergencies Act to declare
national emergencies in which tariffs would help “deal with” the specific
emergency at issue does not mean that Presidents have now lost the
authority exercised by President Nixon to impose tariffs. IEEPA was not
designed as a use-it-or-lose-it source of emergency authority.
(), convincingly show that the
general statutory language has long been understood to
cover the specific power asserted by the Executive, that
record should all but resolve the matter for major questions
purposes.
Third, there is no mismatch: The power to tariff falls
squarely within the President’s wheelhouse. From the
Founding, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion today
acknowledges, numerous other statutes have afforded—
and still do afford—the President broad power to impose
tariffs. Ante, at 8–9. This case is entirely different,
therefore, from our prior major questions cases, where, for
example, the CDC attempted to impose an eviction
moratorium, Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594 U. S., at 763–
765; OSHA sought to implement a nationwide vaccine
mandate, NFIB, 595 U. S., at 117–120; the FDA tried to
regulate cigarettes, Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–
161; and the Attorney General attempted to regulate
physician-assisted suicide, Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 267–268.
Presidents imposing tariffs—whether pursuant to
inherent wartime authority, pursuant to TWEA and
IEEPA’s “regulate . . . importation” language, pursuant to
Section 232’s “adjust the imports” text, or pursuant to the
many other tariff statutory authorities—is hardly an
unusual occurrence in our Nation’s history or in recent
times. For example, Presidents George W. Bush, Obama,
and Biden all imposed tariffs pursuant to congressional
authorization. There is no mismatch between the tariff
power and the President’s “mission and expertise.” West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 748 ().
Fourth, the President is not relying on oblique, elliptical,
or cryptic language. This case does not involve “elephants
in mouseholes.” Whitman, 531 U. S., at 468. This case
instead involves an elephant (tariffs) in a statutory
elephant hole (the power to “regulate . . . importation” to
deal with foreign threats in national emergencies). IEEPA
was a major and thoroughly studied statute carefully
crafted to grant the President a suite of powerful tools,
including to “regulate . . . importation,” and thereby allow
him to respond swiftly to national emergencies and to help
America respond to crises. Since its enactment, Presidents
have invoked IEEPA more than 70 times to deal with
emergencies and threats from the September 11, 2001, al
Qaeda attacks to Iran to North Korea, and many others.
See Congressional Research Service, The International
Emergency Economic Powers Act: Origins, Evolution, and
Use 18–32 (2025).
By 1977, moreover, it was well-known that tariffs on
foreign imports—along with even more powerful tools such
as quotas and embargoes—were a common way to “regulate
. . . importation.” IEEPA thus bears zero resemblance to
the paradigmatic “previously little-used backwater”
statutory provision that cannot support significant
executive actions. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 730.
All of that makes this case dramatically different from—
really, the opposite of—the major questions cases where the
Court has ruled against the Government. The text, the
history, the context, and the precedent all point strongly to
the conclusion that as of 1977, tariffs were a well-
recognized means of regulating importation, like quotas
and embargoes.
As Judge Taranto persuasively summarized, this case
bears none of the hallmarks of past major questions cases
where the Court found a lack of clear congressional
authorization for the Government’s asserted major power.
IEEPA’s “facial breadth in an emergency context makes the
straightforward application of the statute’s words hardly
unheralded, and if a more specific herald is needed, it is
present in the [Nixon] 1971 proclamation, Yoshida CCPA,
and subsequent congressional adoption of the relevant
language in 1977.” 149 F. 4th 1312, 1376 (CA Fed. 2025)
(dissenting opinion) (citations omitted). IEEPA seeks “to
provide flexibility in the tools available to the President to
address the unusual and extraordinary threats specified in
a declared national emergency. This is not an ‘ancillary,’
‘little used backwater’ provision, or a delegation outside the
recipient’s wheelhouse.” Ibid. (citation omitted).
This Court’s recent decision in Biden v. Missouri, 595
U. S. 87 (2022) (per curiam), strongly supports the
President’s position here. That case involved a challenge to
President Biden’s COVID–19 vaccine requirement for
millions of healthcare workers. The executive action there,
too, was undoubtedly major. But the Court upheld the
Government’s vaccine mandate based on a general
statutory authorization for HHS to impose safety
requirements for healthcare facilities—notwithstanding
the lack of explicit statutory reference to vaccines. Id., at
90–96. In doing so, the Court emphasized that state
vaccination requirements were common for healthcare
workers and that the Federal Government regularly
required healthcare workers to take various safety
precautions. Id., at 94–95. Notably, the Court upheld the
vaccine mandate even though (as the dissenters pointed
out) the Federal Government had not traditionally imposed
such vaccine requirements on healthcare workers. See id.,
at 104 ().
The clarity of the congressional authorization in today’s
case is far stronger than in Biden v. Missouri. The Nixon
and Ford tariffs, the Algonquin decision, and the
President’s longstanding authority to regulate trade and
impose tariffs establish—much more comprehensively and
clearly than in Biden v. Missouri—that the President is not
claiming some “unheralded power” that represents a
“transformative expansion” of his authority. Utility Air,
573 U. S., at 324.
Because the Court upheld the Executive’s exercise of a
major power in Biden v. Missouri, it follows that the Court
today should likewise uphold the President’s assertion of a
major power here. Like cases should be treated alike.
In response to all of that, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion
clings to its primary argument in this case—that a statute
must use the word “tariff ” or “duty” or “tax” or the like to
authorize tariffs on foreign imports. But this Court has
repeatedly emphasized that the major questions doctrine is
not a magic words requirement. THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
opinion identifies no case that has demanded such
specificity. And in Algonquin, this Court unanimously and
squarely rejected the same argument that the statutory
provision must specifically mention “tariffs” or “duties” or
“taxes” for the President to impose tariffs on foreign
imports. Under THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion, the Nixon
and Ford tariffs would also have been unlawful. So too
might other tariffs imposed under the longstanding Section
232 tariff statute, which broadly authorizes the President
to “adjust the imports” of a foreign good without mentioning
“tariffs” or “taxes.” And so would tariffs imposed in
wartime under TWEA’s authority to “regulate . . .
importation.”20
THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion’s approach to the major
questions doctrine is a magic-words test under another
name—in contravention of our precedents that make clear
that Congress need not use magic words or “highly specific”
——————
20Under the Court’s decision today, the President’s authority to impose
tariffs under TWEA during wartime is presumably now gone given that
TWEA has the same “regulate . . . importation” language, 50 U. S. C.
§4305(b)(1)(B)—unless the Court thinks that the statutory text somehow
means one thing in TWEA and another in IEEPA, which would be
historically inaccurate and textually unsupportable. One might think
that the Court’s opinion would also mean that tariffs cannot be imposed
under Section 232, which authorizes the President to “adjust the
imports.” After all, that statutory provision likewise does not refer to
“tariffs,” duties,” “taxes,” “fees,” or the like. But in Algonquin, the Court
read Section 232 to authorize tariffs. I assume that the Court today does
not intend to overrule Algonquin.
terms. Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 516 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring) (quotation marks omitted).21
In previous cases, the Court has looked at the four factors
to determine whether there is “clear congressional
authorization” precisely because the major questions canon
has no magic words requirement. If magic words or the
equivalent were necessary, that would be the only factor.
And the Court would not need the four factors that the
Court has consistently applied.22
In sum, under the major questions doctrine as the Court
has applied it, this should be a straightforward case.
Congress supplied clear authorization for the President to
impose tariffs under IEEPA.
