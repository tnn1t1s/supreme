Two additional historical points strongly reinforce that
analysis of text and precedent and further demonstrate
that “regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA encompasses
tariffs.
First, U. S. history from the 1800s through IEEPA’s 1977
enactment illustrates how the statute came to incorporate
the President’s long-recognized authority to impose tariffs
during wartime and then also during peacetime national
emergencies.
Long before the initial 1917 enactment of the Trading
with the Enemy Act, which was IEEPA’s predecessor, the
President possessed inherent wartime authority to prohibit
commercial relations with enemy nations. That inherent
authority included the power to impose tariffs on foreign
imports.
For example, during the Mexican-American War in the
1840s, President Polk permitted only limited trade with
Mexico, subject to tariffs. Some Members of Congress
publicly questioned whether the President possessed that
tariff authority. In response, President Polk justified the
tariffs on the ground that “the military right to exclude
commerce altogether from the ports of the enemy in our
military occupation included the minor right of admitting it
under prescribed conditions.” J. Polk, To the House of
Representatives of the United States (Jan. 2, 1849), in 6
Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents
2522, 2523 (J. Richardson ed. 1897).
In 1854, the Supreme Court agreed with President Polk’s
view, stating: “No one can doubt” that the President, as
“commander-in-chief of our naval force,” possessed the
authority to “regulate import duties.” Cross v. Harrison, 16
How. 164, 189–190.
In 1862, President Lincoln partially lifted an existing
blockade against the Confederate States during the Civil
War. Like President Polk, he then permitted limited trade,
subject to a monetary fee. A group of cotton sellers later
sued, arguing that the fee “was essentially a tax and not
authorized by any act of Congress, which alone had the
power to impose taxes.” Hamilton v. Dillin, 21 Wall. 73, 81
(1875). The Supreme Court rejected that argument,
holding that there was “no question” that requiring a
monetary fee to trade with the Confederate States was part
of “the war power of the United States government.” Id., at
86–87. The existence of war meant “a suspension of
commercial intercourse between the opposing sections of
the country,” so if “such a course of dealing were to be
permitted at all, it would necessarily be upon such
conditions as the government chose to prescribe.” Id., at 87.
And in 1898, during the Spanish-American War,
President McKinley imposed duties “upon the occupation of
any forts and places in the Philippine Islands.” Lincoln v.
United States, 197 U. S. 419, 428 (1905) (quotation marks
omitted). This Court subsequently recognized those
McKinley duties as a lawful wartime measure. Id., at 427–
428.
Why does that wartime history matter? Because when
Congress first enacted the Trading with the Enemy Act in
1917 during World War I, it statutorily codified some of the
President’s longstanding inherent wartime powers over
foreign trade, which included the power to tariff. See
Trading with the Enemy Act, ch. 106, 40 Stat. 411; see also
Brief for Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae 16–19,
26–27. For the duration of World War I, TWEA authorized
the President, when he found “the public safety so
requires,” to make it unlawful “to import into the United
States” from any “named” country certain goods “except at
such time or times, and under such regulations or orders,
and subject to such limitations and exceptions as the
President shall prescribe.” §11, 40 Stat. 422–423.
In 1933, during the Great Depression and five days after
President Franklin Roosevelt took office, Congress
expanded TWEA to apply not only in wartime, but also
during a “national emergency” declared by the President.
48 Stat. 1.
Eight years later, in 1941, a few days after Pearl Harbor,
Congress again amended TWEA’s language by more
succinctly providing that the President may “regulate”
certain transactions, including “importation,” under TWEA
during war or “any other period of national emergency
declared by the President.” 55 Stat. 839.
So as of 1941—and from then to 1977—TWEA expressly
authorized the President to “regulate . . . importation” both
during wartime and during peacetime national
emergencies. Historically, Presidents had regulated
importation by imposing tariffs, as the Polk, Lincoln, and
McKinley tariffs illustrated. So TWEA from 1941 to 1977
was best understood to authorize tariffs. See Brief for
Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae 27–28.
During that period, as I have discussed at length above,
President Nixon in 1971 imposed 10 percent tariffs on
almost all imports of foreign goods and relied on TWEA’s
“regulate . . . importation” language to justify them. Those
tariffs were upheld in court.
Then, in 1977, Congress amended TWEA and divided it
into two statutes. TWEA retained the President’s power to
“regulate . . . importation,” but only during wartime. The
newly enacted second law, IEEPA, also retained the power
to “regulate . . . importation,” and it would apply during
periods of declared national emergencies. As this Court has
previously recognized, IEEPA was “directly drawn” from
TWEA, and the relevant authorities are essentially the
same. Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 671, 672–
673 (1981).
Therefore, IEEPA’s specific language—“regulate . . .
importation”—was not new statutory text when Congress
enacted IEEPA in 1977. Far from it. Beginning in 1941,
TWEA had already authorized the President to “regulate
. . . importation” of foreign goods in wartime and national
emergencies. And the earlier Polk, Lincoln, and McKinley
examples, as well as the later Nixon example,
demonstrated that the power to “regulate . . . importation”
historically encompassed tariffs as well as quotas and
embargoes.
The plaintiffs and the Court today assert that wartime
precedents do not govern peacetime. But Congress modeled
IEEPA on TWEA precisely so that the President could
continue to exercise certain wartime authorities such as
quotas, embargoes, and tariffs during peacetime national
emergencies as well. Congress first explicitly extended that
wartime power to national emergencies in 1933, during the
Franklin Roosevelt Administration. Cf. New State Ice Co.
v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 306 (1932) (Brandeis, J.,
dissenting) (The Great Depression was “an emergency more
serious than war”). And Congress has continued to
authorize the President to exercise that power in both
wartime and peacetime emergencies.
In short, Congress in 1977 enacted the same “regulate . . .
importation” language that had long been understood to
encompass tariffs.
Second, contrary to the tenor of the plaintiffs’ and the
Court’s arguments here, it would not have been at all
unusual or surprising for Congress, when enacting IEEPA
in 1977, to authorize the President to impose tariffs. Since
the early days of the Republic, Congress has regularly
granted the President the power to regulate foreign trade,
including via tariffs.
A few examples: In 1810, Congress authorized the
President to prohibit imports from Great Britain or France
if either nation violated the neutral commerce of the United
States. Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch
382, 382–384, 388 (1813); 2 Stat. 606.
In 1890, Congress granted the President the power to
impose import duties in response to duties imposed by other
countries on American exports. Marshall Field & Co. v.
Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 680–681 (1892); 26 Stat. 612.
In 1922, Congress empowered the President to levy
import duties under certain conditions. J. W. Hampton, Jr.,
& Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394, 400–402 (1928); 42
Stat. 941.
In 1930, Congress enacted Section 338 of the Tariff Act,
which authorizes the President to impose tariffs when he
finds that “any foreign country places any burden or
disadvantage upon the commerce of the United States.” 19
U. S. C. §1338(d); 46 Stat. 705.
In 1962, Congress authorized the President in Section
232 of the Trade Expansion Act to “adjust the imports” of a
foreign good that threatens to impair national security.
§1862(c)(1)(A); 76 Stat. 877.
In 1974, under Section 201 of the Trade Act, Congress
granted the President the power to “take all appropriate
and feasible action within his power,” including imposing a
“duty” on imports that, according to the U. S. International
Trade Commission, have caused or threatened “serious
injury” to a domestic industry. §§2251(a), 2253(a)(1)(A),
(3)(A); 88 Stat. 2014–2015.
So too, Section 301 authorizes the President to direct the
U. S. Trade Representative to “impose duties” on countries
engaging in unfair trade practices. §§2411(a), (c)(1)(B); 88
Stat. 2041–2042.
And Section 122 of the Act grants the President the power
to impose a “temporary import surcharge” to “deal with
large and serious United States balance-of-payment
deficits.” §2132(a)(1)(A); 88 Stat. 1987–1988.
Those many statutes definitively establish that Congress,
since near the Founding, has delegated to the President
broad power to impose tariffs on foreign imports. See also
ante, at 13–15 (). So it would hardly
have been unusual or surprising for Congress to have
granted tariff power to the President during wartime and
peacetime national emergencies, as it did in TWEA and
IEEPA.
To be sure, given those other statutes that authorize the
President to impose tariffs on foreign imports, one might
reasonably ask: Why did the President need distinct tariff
authority under IEEPA during peacetime emergencies—or,
for that matter, under TWEA during wartime?
The basic answer is that IEEPA is an emergency statute
that allows the President to impose tariffs somewhat more
quickly, as would be expected in a declared national
emergency. Similarly, in wartime, TWEA allows the
President to impose tariffs more rapidly.
But critically, TWEA and IEEPA do not authorize the
President to exercise some new substantive power. Rather,
they authorize the President to exercise a commonly
granted power—tariffs—more efficiently than under the
many ordinary tariff statutes.
The plaintiffs and the Court assert that interpreting
IEEPA to authorize tariffs would in effect evade specific
limits on tariffs in certain other tariff statutes. But as
Judge Taranto explained in the Federal Circuit, Congress
in IEEPA understandably afforded the President more
flexibility to act during declared emergencies, just as
Congress had done in TWEA for wartime since 1917. See
149 F. 4th 1312, 1363–1366 (2025) (dissenting opinion).
Moreover, IEEPA is not a blank check. IEEPA contains
its own limits, including the requirement that the tariffs
deal with an unusual and extraordinary foreign threat, 50
U. S. C. §1701(b); a default 1-year limit on emergencies,
§1622(d); an enumerated list of exceptions, §1702(b); and
comprehensive congressional reporting requirements,
§1703. And as noted above, each House of Congress
possesses a variety of tools to revoke, limit, or influence a
President’s IEEPA or TWEA tariffs.
Relatedly, it is also not surprising that the many ordinary
tariff statutes expressly refer to “tariffs,” “duties,” and the
like, while IEEPA and TWEA do not. As Judge Taranto
astutely explained, “Congress in those statutes was
overwhelmingly focused on tariff issues,” whereas
“Congress in IEEPA (as in TWEA) was focused on the
subject of emergencies and giving plainly broad emergency
authority regarding foreign property.” 149 F. 4th, at 1364
(dissenting opinion).
In sum, in authorizing the President to “regulate . . .
importation,” IEEPA embodies an “eyes-open congressional
grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs
realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities
available under non-emergency laws, and Congress
confirmed the understood breadth by tying IEEPA’s
authority to particularly demanding procedural
requirements for keeping Congress informed.” Id., at 1348.
