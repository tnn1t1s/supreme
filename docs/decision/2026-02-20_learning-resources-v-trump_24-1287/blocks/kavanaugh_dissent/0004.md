I begin as always with the statutory text.
In 1941, a few days after Pearl Harbor, Congress first
enacted the relevant language, “regulate . . . importation,”
in an amendment to the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act,
known as TWEA. 55 Stat. 839; 40 Stat. 411. After that
1941 amendment, TWEA authorized the President to
“regulate . . . importation” both during wartime and during
peacetime national emergencies.
Then, in 1977, Congress split TWEA into two separate
statutes. As relevant here, Congress amended TWEA to
authorize the President to “regulate . . . importation”
during wartime only. 91 Stat. 1625. And Congress enacted
a separate statute, IEEPA, that granted the President the
power to “regulate . . . importation” during peacetime
national emergencies. Id., at 1626.
The relevant IEEPA text authorized the President to
“regulate . . . importation” “by means of instructions,
licenses, or otherwise.” Ibid.; 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)
(emphasis added). As the term “otherwise” indicates, the
broadly worded statute did not exclude tariffs or dictate any
specific means of regulating importation.5
At the time of TWEA’s amendment in 1941 and IEEPA’s
enactment in 1977, the ordinary dictionary meaning of
“regulate” was to “control,” to “adjust by rule,” or to “subject

acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal,
transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising
any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving,
any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any
interest by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States.” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1) (emphasis
added).
5Congress no doubt appreciated that quotas, embargoes, tariffs, and
the like can be powerful tools for regulating foreign commerce. Congress
calibrated the statute by exempting various categories of goods, meaning
that those categories of goods are not subject to tariffs under IEEPA.
§1702(b).
to governing principles or laws.” Black’s Law Dictionary
1156 (5th ed. 1979); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1519
(3d ed. 1933) (same); Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary 1913 (1976) (defining “regulate” as “to govern or
direct according to rule” and “to bring under the control of
law or constituted authority”); American Heritage
Dictionary 1096 (1969) (“[t]o control or direct according to a
rule”; “[t]o adjust in conformity to a specification or
requirement”).
Imposing tariffs on imports is clearly a way of controlling
imports (Black’s); governing or directing imports according
to rule (Webster’s, American Heritage); adjusting imports
by rule, method, or established mode (Black’s, American
Heritage); or more generally subjecting imports to
governing principles or laws (Black’s). So the dictionary
definitions amply demonstrate that tariffs are a means to
“regulate . . . importation” of foreign imports.6
Consistent with those dictionary definitions and
statutory references, tariffs historically have been—and
still are—a common means for the United States to
regulate importation of foreign goods. See, e.g., Section 338
of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 704–706 (19 U. S. C.
§1338); Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, 76
Stat. 877 (19 U. S. C. §1862); Title II of the Trade Act of
1974, 88 Stat. 2011 (19 U. S. C. §2251 et seq.); Title III of
the Trade Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 2041 (19 U. S. C. §2411
et seq.).7

6As other statutory authorities textually confirm, moreover, Congress
has long understood tariffs to be a tool for regulating imports. For
example, Section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930 refers to “duties and other
import restrictions.” 19 U. S. C. §§1351(a)(1)(B), (c). And Section 122 of
the Trade Act of 1974 uses the phrase “restrict imports” to cover duties.
§2132(a). Both statutes take it as a given, therefore, that tariffs are a
means of regulating imports.
7As the parties and the Court use the terms, “tariffs” and “duties” are
synonymous.
In determining the ordinary meaning of “regulate
. . . importation,” the meaning of the related phrase
“regulate commerce” is also instructive. That phrase has
long been interpreted to encompass tariffs. Since the
Founding, the Constitution’s assignment to Congress of the
broad power to “regulate” foreign commerce has been
understood to include tariffs on foreign imports. See Art. I,
§8. As Chief Justice Marshall explained, the “right to
regulate commerce, even by the imposition of duties, was not
controverted.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824)
(emphasis added). So too Justice Story: The “power to
regulate commerce includes the power of laying duties to
countervail the regulations and restrictions of foreign
nations.” 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of
the United States 530 (1833) (emphasis added). And still
more Story: To “lay duties” is a “common means of
executing the power” to “regulate commerce.” Id., at 531
(emphasis added). James Madison likewise stated that it
cannot “be inferred” that the “power to regulate trade does
not involve a power to tax it.” Letter from J. Madison to J.
Cabell, Sept. 18, 1828, in 9 Writings of James Madison 326
(G. Hunt ed. 1910) (emphasis added).
Marshall, Story, and Madison make for a formidable trio.
And this Court has long echoed the Marshall-Story-
Madison understanding that tariffs “regulate” foreign
commerce. The “laying of a duty on imports, although an
exercise of the taxing power, is also an exercise of the power
to regulate foreign commerce.” McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil
Corp., 309 U. S. 414, 428 (1940) (emphasis added). And
again: Even though “the taxing power is a distinct power
and embraces the power to lay duties, it does not follow that
duties may not be imposed in the exercise of the power to
regulate commerce. The contrary is well established.”
Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U. S.
48, 58 (1933) (emphasis added).8
The plaintiffs and the Court today seize on the word
“regulate” in isolation, and say that it does not encompass
the power to tariff. Ante, at 14–16. But the relevant
statutory phrase is “regulate . . . importation.” And we
must look to the meaning of the phrase as a whole, as our
precedents dictate. See FCC v. AT&T Inc., 562 U. S. 397,
406 (2011) (“[T]wo words together may assume a more
particular meaning than those words in isolation”). As I
have explained, since the Founding, tariffs on foreign
imports have been a common means of regulating foreign
commerce, including imports. Notably, under the Court’s
reading of the word “regulate,” Marshall, Story, and
Madison all erred by concluding that the power to
“regulate” foreign commerce includes the power to impose
tariffs on foreign imports. That seems dubious.
If the Federal Government’s constitutional power to
“regulate” foreign commerce includes tariffs (as this Court
has repeatedly said), and if the power to “regulate . . .
importation” is the power to regulate foreign commerce
with respect to imports (as it plainly is), then IEEPA’s
authorization for the President to “regulate . . .
importation” clearly encompasses tariffs. Historical usage
and that textual syllogism further buttress the dictionary
definitions and help establish that tariffs are a means to
regulate importation.9

8Importantly, those historical sources also fully demonstrate that the
Foreign Commerce Clause, not just the Taxing Clause, authorizes tariffs
on foreign imports. See Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill., 289 U. S., at
58.
9The plaintiffs and the Court offer a double-bankshot argument that
“regulate . . . importation” cannot include monetary exactions because
IEEPA also authorizes the President to “regulate . . . exportation,” and
imposing duties on exports would violate the Constitution. Ante, at 15.
But as the Government thoroughly explains, when a statute contains a
