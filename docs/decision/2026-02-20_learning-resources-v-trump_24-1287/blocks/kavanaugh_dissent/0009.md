Because the major questions doctrine demands “clear
congressional authorization,” this Court has repeatedly
recognized that the doctrine is “distinct” from “routine
statutory interpretation.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 724
(quotation marks omitted). Importantly, therefore, the
doctrine applies—and makes a meaningful difference—only
in cases where the Executive’s “reading of a statute”
“would, under more ordinary circumstances, be upheld.”
Ibid. (quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 740, 742,
n. 3 (); M. Sohoni, The Major
Questions Quartet, 136 Harv. L. Rev. 262, 272–276 (2022).
To properly set up the inquiry: A major questions issue
arises when: (i) the Executive relies on the text of a
generally worded statute to exercise a specific power of
major economic and political significance; (ii) the generally
worded statute does not explicitly mention the specific
major power, but (iii) the asserted major power falls within
the generally worded text of the statute such that the
Executive’s assertion of that power “would, under more
ordinary circumstances, be upheld,” West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 724 (majority opinion) (quotation marks omitted).17
The question then is whether the generally worded
statute supplies “clear congressional authorization” for the
Executive to exercise that specific—but not explicitly
mentioned—major power. Here, for example, does the
generally worded statutory authorization for the President
to “regulate . . . importation” clearly authorize the
President to impose tariffs?
——————
17Of course, if the major power does not fall within the generally
worded text as a matter of ordinary statutory interpretation, the major
questions doctrine is not implicated or necessary to apply because the
Government’s statutory argument fails to begin with.
The requirement of “clear congressional authorization” is
easy enough to state. But how do we apply it? How do we
decide in a particular case whether a generally worded
statute actually constitutes “clear congressional
authorization” for a major power that otherwise falls within
the general terms?
For starters, and critically, the Court has repeatedly
emphasized that the major questions doctrine is not a
magic words requirement. In other words, the doctrine does
not require an explicit reference to the specific major power
itself. As the Court’s cases amply demonstrate, the major
questions doctrine does not “forc[e] Congress to delegate in
highly specific terms.” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 516
() (quotation marks omitted).
Rather than require magic words (such as the words
“tariff ” or “duty” here), the Court’s cases have focused on
four somewhat overlapping factors or considerations in
order to assess whether a generally worded statute
constitutes “clear congressional authorization” for the
specific major power.18
First, the major questions doctrine’s most prominent
work has been to ensure that the Executive cannot
suddenly seize on an old and generally worded statute to
exercise a power of great economic and political significance
when that power would not reasonably have been
understood at the time of enactment to fall within that
generally worded statute. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
720–735; Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–161. As
the Court has said: “When an agency claims to discover in
a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a
——————
18 Both JUSTICE GORSUCH and JUSTICE BARRETT have likewise read the
Court’s precedents to identify those same four factors, as they explained
in their incisive separate opinions in West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v.
Nebraska, respectively. See 597 U. S. 697, 746–749 (2022) (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring) (referring to the four “telling clues”); 600 U. S., at 517–520
(); see also ante, at 27 ().
significant portion of the American economy, we typically
greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism.”
Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324 (citation and quotation marks
omitted); West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 748 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring).
The doctrine thus precludes an agency’s attempt to
effectuate “a fundamental revision of the statute.” MCI
Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994). Stated otherwise,
an “agency’s attempt to deploy an old statute focused on one
problem to solve a new and different problem” may be “a
warning sign that it is acting without clear congressional
authority.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 747 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring). The Court’s skepticism about major executive
action in those scenarios has been heightened when
Congress has “conspicuously and repeatedly declined to
enact” legislation that would have authorized the executive
action in question. Id., at 724 (majority opinion).
A prototypical example occurred when OSHA, in order to
justify a nationwide COVID–19 vaccine mandate for
workers, relied “on a statutory provision that was adopted
40 years before the pandemic and that focused on
conditions specific to the workplace.” Id., at 747 (GORSUCH,
J., concurring). Another example arose when EPA invoked
“newfound authority to regulate” emissions from “millions
of small sources—including retail stores, offices, apartment
buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches.” Utility
Air, 573 U. S., at 328. Yet another happened when the CDC
tried to impose an eviction moratorium for rental housing
through an “unprecedented” assertion of its authority to
regulate public health. Alabama Assn. of Realtors, 594
U. S., at 765.
Second, courts examine the “agency’s past
interpretations of the relevant statute.” West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 747 (). The Executive’s
“track record can be particularly probative” in the major
questions context. Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 519
().
A “contemporaneous and long-held Executive Branch
interpretation of a statute is entitled to some weight.” West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 747 ()
(quotation marks omitted). Just “as established practice
may shed light on the extent of power conveyed by general
statutory language, so the want of assertion of power by
those who presumably would be alert to exercise it, is
equally significant in determining whether such power was
actually conferred.” Id., at 725 (majority opinion)
(quotation marks omitted).
The NFIB Court therefore found it critical that “OSHA,
in its half century of existence, has never before adopted a
broad public health regulation of this kind” under the
statute that the agency sought to invoke as authority for
the vaccine mandate. 595 U. S., at 119. Likewise, in Brown
& Williamson, the FDA had “repeatedly and consistently
assert[ed] that it lacks jurisdiction under the FDCA to
regulate tobacco products.” 529 U. S., at 156. And in West
Virginia, EPA had not “previously interpreted the relevant
provision to confer on it such vast authority” to transform
American industry. 597 U. S., at 749 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring).
Third, courts assess whether “there is a mismatch
between an agency’s challenged action and its
congressionally assigned mission and expertise,” id., at 748
()—in other words, whether an
agency is trying to regulate “outside its wheelhouse,” Biden
v. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 518 ().
In the NFIB case, OSHA, which is empowered to “set
workplace safety standards, not broad public health
measures,” mandated COVID–19 vaccines. 595 U. S., at
117. In Alabama Assn. of Realtors, the CDC—a public
health agency—attempted to regulate housing. 594 U. S.,
at 763–765. In Gonzales v. Oregon, the Attorney General
sought to assert authority over the drugs used in physician-
assisted suicide. 546 U. S. 243, 267–268 (2006).
All of those cases involved serious mismatches between
the agency’s usual regulatory activities and its asserted
major power.
Fourth, the Court looks at whether the relevant statutory
language used to justify the Executive’s exercise of a major
power is “oblique,” “elliptical,” or “cryptic.” West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 746–747 ()
(alterations and quotation marks omitted). As the Court
has often said, Congress does not “hide elephants” in
statutory “mouseholes.” Whitman v. American Trucking
Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).
In MCI Telecommunications Corp., for example, the
Court refused to allow the FCC to eliminate rate regulation
and fundamentally overhaul the telecommunications
industry based on a “subtle” provision that merely
permitted the FCC to “modify” rate-filing requirements.
512 U. S., at 231 (quotation marks omitted). In Brown &
Williamson, the Court rejected the FDA’s attempt to
regulate the tobacco industry based on a “cryptic” statutory
provision that referred to “safety.” 529 U. S., at 160
(quotation marks omitted). In Gonzales, the Court said that
Congress would not have granted the Attorney General the
power to regulate physician-assisted suicide through
“oblique” statutory language. 546 U. S., at 267. And in
West Virginia, the Court found it unlikely that Congress
would have granted major power to reshape the energy
industry in a “previously little-used backwater” of the
statute. 597 U. S., at 730.
