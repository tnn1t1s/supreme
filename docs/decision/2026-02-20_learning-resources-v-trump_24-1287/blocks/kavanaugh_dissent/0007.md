Finally, all of that text, history, and precedent is further
reinforced by two compelling pieces of context.
First, interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates
nonsensical textual and practical anomalies. The plaintiffs
and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in
declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or
even total embargoes on all imports from a given country.
But the President supposedly cannot take the far more
modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a
tariff or duty.
Textually, however, if quotas and embargoes are a means
to regulate importation, how are tariffs not a means to
regulate importation? Nothing in the text supports such an
illogical distinction.
And it does not make much sense to think that IEEPA
allows the President in a declared national emergency to,
for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but
not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China. As
Judge Taranto forcefully pointed out in the Federal Circuit,
tariffs are “just a less extreme, more flexible tool for
pursuing the same objective of controlling the amount or
price of imports that, after all, could be barred altogether.”
149 F. 4th, at 1363 (dissenting opinion). All of that explains
why this Court in Algonquin definitively rejected such a
strange slice-and-dice approach to the President’s statutory
power to “adjust” imports. If quotas and embargoes are
authorized, so are tariffs.
In short, whether through prohibiting imports via
embargoes or regulating the quantity of imports through
quotas or regulating the price of imports with tariffs,
Congress granted the President flexibility in declared
national emergencies to take various actions affecting
imports of foreign goods. The plaintiffs and the Court have
no coherent textual or commonsensical explanation for why
a rational Congress would, in such a momentous and
carefully considered statute as IEEPA, grant the President
the power to impose quotas and embargoes, but not tariffs,
on foreign imports during emergencies.
Second, IEEPA was not debated and passed in a vacuum
in 1977—it was enacted around the same time that
Congress significantly constrained executive power in
multiple ways in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam. The
list of major new statutory restrictions on Presidential
power enacted in the 1970s is long and extraordinary, with
lasting effects to the present day.14
And Congress, during that comprehensive examination
and recalibration of government power, did not overlook
TWEA and the President’s emergency authorities. Led by
Senators Church and Mathias, Congress carefully studied
the President’s emergency authorities, including TWEA.
Then, in 1976 and 1977, Congress enacted a variety of
legislation to tighten up the President’s emergency powers,
including by passing a new National Emergencies Act that
cabined the President’s authority to declare emergencies by
setting forth various procedural requirements.
Yet when enacting IEEPA in 1977, Congress continued to
grant the President the power to “regulate . . . importation”

in declared national emergencies—a power that the
President had possessed since 1941 under TWEA and that
had recently been invoked by President Nixon to justify his
1971 tariffs. In IEEPA (and TWEA) in 1977, Congress
consciously balanced concerns about expansive exercises of
emergency powers against the necessity of equipping the
President with tools to address exigencies that are difficult
if not impossible to foresee. That broader congressional
context—general skepticism and scaling back of executive
power combined with re-enactment of the familiar “regulate
. . . importation” language in IEEPA—strongly indicates
that Congress said what it meant and meant what it said
when it enacted IEEPA and continued to authorize the
President to “regulate . . . importation” during national
emergencies.
