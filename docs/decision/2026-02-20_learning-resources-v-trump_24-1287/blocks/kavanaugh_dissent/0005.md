Perhaps even more significantly, when IEEPA was
enacted in 1977, Congress and the public clearly would
have understood that the phrase “regulate . . . importation”
encompassed tariffs. We know as much not only because of
the dictionary definitions and the traditional
understanding of tariffs as a tool to regulate foreign
imports. We also know as much because of tariffs imposed
by two Presidents and approved by federal courts, including
the Supreme Court, in the years shortly before IEEPA’s
1977 enactment.
First, in 1971, President Nixon imposed 10 percent tariffs
across the board on virtually all imports from every country
in the world. Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 3 CFR
60–61 (1971–1975 Comp.). Those tariffs were justified
under IEEPA’s predecessor statute, the Trading with the
Enemy Act, or TWEA.10 Like IEEPA now, TWEA at that
time authorized the President to “regulate . . . importation”
during national emergencies, as well as wartime. And like
IEEPA now, TWEA did not specifically use the words
“tariff ” or “duty.”

long string of verbs and nouns, each term should be understood in
context. The relevant section of IEEPA contains 9 verbs and 11 objects,
for a total of 99 combinations. We do not need to construe each word of
the statute to ensure that it is perfectly aligned in all 99 pairings. See
Reply Brief 17; Robers v. United States, 572 U. S. 639, 643–644 (2014);
Department of Agriculture Rural Development Rural Housing Service v.
Kirtz, 601 U. S. 42, 61 (2024) (We may not “disregard the statute’s clear
terms” simply because there may be “a valid constitutional defense” to
some applications).
10President Nixon did not explicitly cite the “regulate . . . importation”
language of TWEA when imposing those worldwide tariffs. But that
merely reflected a diplomatic nicety given the title of the “Trading with
the Enemy Act” and the desire to avoid publicly suggesting that allies
were enemies. Once in court, the President openly invoked the “regulate
. . . importation” language of TWEA as justification for the tariffs. See
United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 569–571 (CCPA 1975).
The Nixon tariffs did not fly below the radar. On the
contrary, President Nixon announced the worldwide 10
percent tariffs in a primetime address to the Nation on
August 15, 1971. He imposed the tariffs as a tool “to make
certain that American products will not be at a
disadvantage” and that “the product of American labor will
be more competitive.” Public Papers of the Presidents,
Richard Nixon, Aug. 15, 1971, p. 889. President Nixon
sought to remove “the unfair edge that some of our foreign
competition has,” and he declared that when “the unfair
treatment is ended, the import tax will end.” Ibid.
The Nixon tariffs applied to almost all imports of foreign
goods into the United States. And the tariffs had no time
limit. To be sure, they did not end up lasting forever. But
President Nixon terminated them only because the tariffs
(as intended) induced major American trading partners to
negotiate new agreements. Presidential Proclamation No.
4098, 3 CFR 94 (1971–1975 Comp.).
The Nixon tariffs garnered substantial national and
international attention, and were generally popular in
Congress. Predictably, however, the tariffs sparked
litigation challenges. In 1975, the Court of Customs and
Patent Appeals, the predecessor to the Federal Circuit,
upheld the Nixon tariffs as a lawful exercise of the
President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation” under
TWEA. United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560,
576, 583–584. The losing plaintiffs did not seek further
review in this Court.
Two years later in 1977, when Congress divided TWEA
into two, Congress retained that same “regulate . . .
importation” language in both laws—in TWEA for wartime
and in IEEPA for peacetime national emergencies. In doing
so, Members of Congress were plainly aware—after all, how
could they not be—that the “regulate . . . importation”
language had recently been invoked by the President and
interpreted by the courts to encompass tariffs. Indeed, the
House Committee Report noted that the relevant “regulate
. . . importation” provision in TWEA “came into play when,
on August 15, 1971, President Nixon declared a national
emergency with respect to the balance-of-payments crisis
and under that emergency imposed a surcharge on
imports.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–459, p. 5 (1977). The Report
further referenced the appeals court’s holding in Yoshida
that TWEA “authorized imposition of duties” because of
“the existence of the national emergency.” H. R. Rep. No.
95–459, at 5.11
The Nixon tariffs persuasively demonstrate that
Members of Congress and the public would have
understood the phrase “regulate . . . importation” to include
tariffs when IEEPA was enacted in 1977. If Congress
wanted to exclude tariffs from IEEPA’s scope, why would it
enact the exact statutory language from TWEA that had
just been invoked by the President and interpreted by the
courts to cover tariffs? Neither the plaintiffs nor the Court
today offers a good answer to that question.
Understandably so, because there is no good answer.
The Court tries to dodge the force of the Nixon tariffs by
observing that one appeals court’s interpretation of
“regulate . . . importation” to uphold President Nixon’s
tariffs does not suffice to describe that interpretation as
“well-settled” when IEEPA was enacted in 1977. Ante, at
17–18. Fair enough. But that is not the right question. The
question is what Members of Congress and the public would
have understood “regulate . . . importation” to mean when
Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977. See New Prime Inc. v.
Oliveira, 586 U. S. 105, 113 (2019). Given the significant
and well-known Nixon tariffs, it is entirely implausible to
——————
11I cite the Committee Report not for determining the meaning of
IEEPA, but rather to help show as an historical and factual matter that
Members of Congress were aware of both the Nixon tariffs and the
appeals court decision upholding those tariffs as a tool to “regulate . . .
importation.”
think that Congress’s 1977 re-enactment of the phrase
“regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA was somehow meant
or understood to exclude tariffs.12
Second, if one holds any lingering doubts about
Congress’s and the public’s understanding of the power to
“regulate . . . importation” as of 1977, a second episode
shortly before IEEPA’s enactment should answer them.
In 1975, President Ford imposed significant monetary
exactions on foreign imports of oil. Presidential
Proclamation No. 4341, 3 CFR 433 (1971–1975 Comp.). He
acted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
Like TWEA and IEEPA, the relevant provision of Section
232 did not use the word “tariff ” or “duty.” Rather, Section
232 broadly authorized the President to “adjust the
imports” of a product, 19 U. S. C. §1862(b) (1970 ed.)—
language akin to the “regulate . . . importation” language in
IEEPA and TWEA.
In contrast to the Nixon tariffs, the Ford tariffs on oil
imports generated some pushback in Congress. And a
group of utility companies and States quickly sued, arguing
that the relevant statutory phrase “adjust the imports” did
not authorize monetary exactions such as tariffs.
Over a dissent, the D. C. Circuit agreed with the
plaintiffs challenging the Ford tariffs. Much like the
Court’s decision today, the D. C. Circuit in the Ford matter
concluded that Congress must explicitly authorize
monetary exactions and that the applicable statutory
phrase, “adjust the imports,” did not do so. Algonquin SNG,
——————
12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion also tries to dismiss President Nixon’s
tariffs as being of “limited amount, duration, and scope.” Ante, at 10, n.
3. That claim appears incorrect on all three points, as Judge Taranto
carefully explained in his Federal Circuit opinion. 149 F. 4th 1312,
1367–1369 (2025) (dissenting opinion). President Nixon imposed 10
percent tariffs on virtually all imports from every country in the world
for an unspecified duration. See Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 3
CFR 60–61 (1971–1975 Comp.).
Inc. v. Federal Energy Admin., 518 F. 2d 1051, 1055 (CADC
1975).
In 1976, the Ford tariffs case came to the Supreme Court.
In this Court, the plaintiffs pressed nearly identical
arguments (and rhetorical flourishes) as those advanced by
the plaintiffs and repeated by the Court in today’s case.
The plaintiffs argued that the Ford-imposed monetary
exactions involved “the broadest exercise of the tariff power
in the history of the American Republic,” reminiscent of
“George III’s stamp tax.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in Federal Energy
Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., O. T. 1975, No. 75–
382, p. 26. They contended that the statute’s authorization
for the President to “adjust the imports” did not allow for
such monetary exactions because the statute did “not
mention the tariff on its face.” Ibid. They asserted that this
Court had “never implied a tax, never in the history of this
Court from language which does not explicitly provide for
tax, and here there is no such language, there is no
language that mentions a measure of tax nor a method of
calculation of tax. There is no such thing.” Id., at 33. They
echoed the D. C. Circuit’s holding that reading the phrase
“adjust the imports” to encompass tariffs would be “an
anomalous departure” from “the consistently explicit, well-
defined manner in which Congress has delegated control
over foreign trade and tariffs.” Algonquin, 518 F. 2d, at
1055. And they claimed that interpreting the statute to
include fees “undermines the whole tariff structure of the
United States.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in Algonquin, at 26.
Importantly, the Algonquin plaintiffs acknowledged (as
do the plaintiffs and the Court in today’s case) that the
statutory language “adjust the imports” would allow the
President to impose quotas and embargoes on foreign
imports. See Brief for Respondents in Algonquin, No. 75–
382, pp. 26–27, and n. 30. So a President could completely
block all imports or limit their quantity. But according to
the plaintiffs, Congress’s “adjust the imports” language
precluded the President from exercising the lesser power of
imposing monetary exactions such as tariffs.
The Supreme Court decided the Ford tariffs case in 1976.
The Court unanimously reversed the D. C. Circuit and
flatly rejected the plaintiffs’ arguments. The Court held
that the statutory phrase “adjust the imports”—even
though it did not include terms such as “tariff,” “tax,”
“duty,” or “fee”—granted President Ford the authority to
impose not only quotas and embargoes, but also monetary
exactions on foreign imports. Federal Energy
Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548, 561
(1976).
The Court analyzed the statutory text and found “no
support in the language of the statute” for the plaintiffs’
argument that “adjust the imports” should “be read to
encompass only quantitative methods—i.e., quotas—as
opposed to monetary methods—i.e., license fees—of
effecting such adjustments.” Ibid. The Court further
explained: “Unless one assumes, and we do not, that quotas
will always be a feasible method of dealing directly with
national security threats posed by the circumstances under
which imports are entering the country, limiting the
President to the use of quotas would effectively and
artificially prohibit him from directly dealing with some of
the very problems against which §232(b) is directed.” Id.,
at 561–562 (quotation marks omitted).
In short, according to the unanimous Algonquin Court,
the statutory text, structure, and logic of Section 232
definitively established that the President’s authority to
“adjust the imports” encompassed not only quotas and
embargoes, but also monetary exactions such as tariffs and
fees.
Today’s case should follow a fortiori from Algonquin. No
meaningful daylight exists between the statutory phrase
“adjust the imports” in Section 232 at issue in Algonquin
and the phrase “regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA at
issue here. The plaintiffs and the Court in this case do not
even try to distinguish “adjust the imports” from “regulate
. . . importation.” Nor could they. Recall that the dictionary
definition of “regulate” includes “adjust by rule.” Black’s
Law Dictionary, at 1156 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added).
To adjust imports is to regulate imports. Indeed, if
anything, the phrase “regulate . . . importation” is broader
in scope than the phrase “adjust the imports.”
So if Section 232’s “adjust the imports” includes tariffs—
as this Court unanimously concluded in Algonquin in 1976
just a year before IEEPA—how can IEEPA’s “regulate . . .
importation” not include tariffs?
Algonquin’s importance for today’s case rests not merely
on its status as a unanimous on-point Supreme Court
statutory precedent—although it is surely significant for
that reason as well. The case is especially consequential for
present purposes because it helps show the ordinary public
and congressional understanding of “regulate . . .
importation” in 1977 when Congress enacted IEEPA.
To be clear, the question here is not what individual
Members of Congress might have subjectively intended in
1977. The question is the ordinary meaning and
understanding of the words that Congress used. Given that
the phrase “adjust the imports”—again, in a statutory
provision that did not use specific words such as “tariff ” or
“duty”—was unanimously held by this Court in 1976 to
include tariffs, and given that President Nixon had
similarly relied on his statutory authority to “regulate . . .
importation” to impose 10 percent tariffs on virtually all
imports from all countries, could a rational citizen or
Member of Congress in 1977 have understood “regulate . . .
importation” in IEEPA not to encompass tariffs? I think
not. Any citizens or Members of Congress in 1977 who
somehow thought that the “regulate . . . importation”
language in IEEPA excluded tariffs would have had their
heads in the sand.
The Court today tries its best to distinguish Algonquin on
the ground that Section 232 included “sweeping” language
authorizing the President to take “such action” that “he
deems necessary,” whereas IEEPA does not. Ante, at 19.
But the Algonquin Court did not rely on that language and
instead focused on whether the phrase “adjust the imports”
included monetary exactions. See 426 U. S., at 561.
Moreover, IEEPA itself broadly authorizes the President to
“regulate . . . importation” “by means of instructions,
licenses, or otherwise” in order to “deal with” an “unusual
and extraordinary” foreign “threat” to the “national
security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.”
50 U. S. C. §§1701(a), 1702(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). That
language is similarly expansive, authorizing the President
to employ various tools to “regulate . . . importation.” In
short, just as the phrase “adjust the imports” includes
tariffs, as Algonquin held, so too the phrase “regulate . . .
importation” includes tariffs.13
The Court also attempts to brush aside Algonquin by
citing an entirely different provision of the Trade
Expansion Act—one that was not at issue in Algonquin—
that expressly refers to a “duty.” Ante, at 19. But the
Algonquin Court did not rely on—or even mention—that
provision when concluding that the statutory phrase
“adjust the imports” includes tariffs. For good reason. That
provision, which states that “[n]o action shall be taken” to
“decrease or eliminate” an existing “duty or other import
restriction,” 19 U. S. C. §1862(a) (1970 ed.), concerns only
the power to reduce existing tariffs and plainly does not
bear on a President’s power to impose tariffs under Section
232.
——————
13In addition, IEEPA expressly authorizes the President to require
licenses. And to obtain a license, a business may need to pay license fees
that can be equivalent to tariffs. See §1702(a)(1).
To sum up on the Nixon and Ford tariffs: When enacting
IEEPA in 1977, Congress employed the exact language
recently invoked by President Nixon to justify 10 percent
worldwide tariffs. And IEEPA came fast on the heels of this
Court’s unanimous 1976 decision in Algonquin, which held
that substantially similar “adjust the imports” language
authorized President Ford’s tariffs on oil imports.
Importantly, moreover, the statutory provisions
authorizing the Nixon and Ford tariffs did not use specific
words such as “tariff ” or “duty.”
The Nixon and Ford tariffs, this Court’s decision in
Algonquin, and the ordinary and historical understanding
of tariffs as a means of regulating imports together render
it all but impossible to conclude that Congress in 1977
implicitly excluded tariffs when retaining TWEA’s
“regulate . . . importation” language in IEEPA. If Congress
in 1977 wanted to exclude tariffs from the President’s
IEEPA toolkit, either it would have not retained the phrase
“regulate . . . importation,” or it would otherwise have made
clear in IEEPA that the power to impose tariffs was
excluded. Congress did neither.
