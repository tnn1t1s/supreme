25–250 v.
V.O.S. SELECTIONS, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and
JUSTICE JACKSON join, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.
The Court holds today that the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the Pres-
ident to impose tariffs. I agree with that conclusion, as I do
with the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning. But be-
cause I think the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation
amply support today’s result, I do not join the part of that
opinion invoking the so-called major-questions doctrine.
The question that part asks, similar to the one posed in
other “‘major questions’ cases,” is whether the President
can identify “clear congressional authorization” for his ac-
tion—here, to impose tariffs under IEEPA. Ante, at 7, 13,
20. The demand is for a clear statement—something more
explicit or specific than the statutory basis that would ordi-
narily suffice to support executive action. See, e.g., West
Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 721–724, 732 (2022); Biden
v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 505–506 (2023). The reason for
that requirement, according to today’s opinion, is that the
Executive has claimed an “extraordinary” power—one
never asserted before and having large-scale “economic and
political significance.” Ante, at 7, 11; see ante, at 7–11.
I objected, in the principal cases cited, to the demand for
a special brand of legislative clarity. See West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 764–784 (KAGAN, J., dissenting); Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 542–550 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). In my view, the
Court used its clear-authorization rule in those cases to ne-
gate expansive delegations Congress had approved. I ex-
plained there that the proper way to interpret a delegation
provision is through the standard rules of statutory con-
struction. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 765–766 (KAGAN,
J., dissenting). That means, most concisely stated, reading
text in context. More expansively put, it means examining
a delegation provision’s language, assessing that provi-
sion’s place in the broader statutory scheme, and applying
a “modicum of common sense” about how Congress typically
delegates. Id., at 764 (KAGAN, J., dissenting); see FDA v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 133
(2000). The last of those inquiries includes consideration of
whether Congress ever has before, or likely would, delegate
the power the Executive asserts—a matter also of import in
applying the major-questions doctrine. See ante, at 8–10;
Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512–514, 517–519 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring); id., at 546, n. 3 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). In the
past, though, I have thought that the Court used that doc-
trine to override—rather than help discover—the best read-
ing of delegation statutes. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
756 (KAGAN, J., dissenting); Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 543
(KAGAN, J., dissenting).
This case presents more nearly the opposite situation:
The use of a clear-statement rule here is unnecessary be-
cause ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to
the same result.1 It is not just that the Government’s argu-
ments fail to satisfy an especially strict test; it is that they
fail to satisfy the normal one. Even without a clear-state-
ment rule in the picture, the conclusion follows: IEEPA does
not authorize the President to impose tariffs. And indeed,
the principal opinion’s reasoning well explains why. The
rest of this opinion draws on that analysis (I hope without
too much rehashing) to demonstrate what I view as the fun-
damental point: Usual text-in-context interpretation dooms
the tariffs the President has imposed. The crucial provision
of IEEPA, when viewed in light of the broader statutory
scheme and with a practical awareness of how Congress
delegates tariff authority, does not give the President the
power he wants.
Most important, IEEPA’s key phrase—the one the Gov-
ernment relies on—says nothing about imposing tariffs or
——————
1 JUSTICE GORSUCH claims not to understand this statement, insisting
that I now must be applying the major-questions doctrine, and his own
version of it to boot. See ante, at 17 (concurring opinion) (“My concurring
colleagues all but endorse it today”); ante, at 2, 7, 18 (similar). Given
how strong his apparent desire for converts, see ante, at 2–26, I almost
regret to inform him that I am not one. But that is the fact of the matter.
I proceed in this case just as I did in West Virginia and Nebraska: I con-
sider a delegation provision’s language, broaden the scope to take in the
statutory setting, and apply some common sense about how Congress
normally delegates. See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 756–766
(2022) (KAGAN, J., dissenting); Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 534–
