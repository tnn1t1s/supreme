Now turn to my concurring colleagues’ other charge: that
the major questions doctrine is premised on an “anti-admin-
istrative-state stance.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 780
(KAGAN, J., dissenting). It is important, they argue, to al-
low Congress to delegate expansive powers. Members of
Congress unfortunately “often don’t know enough—and
know they don’t know enough—to regulate sensibly on an
issue.” Id., at 781. Nor can Congress easily “anticipate
changing circumstances.” Ibid. For these reasons, Mem-
bers of Congress must rely on more adept and less con-
strained “people . . . found in agencies.” Ibid. Indeed, my
colleagues say, “administrative delegations . . . have helped
to build a modern Nation.” Id., at 782. And the major ques-
tions doctrine, they worry, could jeopardize all that “aston-
ish[ing] . . . progress.” Ibid.
This policy complaint, of course, is no reason to disregard
our precedents or longstanding legal principles. But, even
taken on its own terms, it is a bit perplexing. The major
questions doctrine is not “anti-administrative state.” It is
pro-Congress. Common-law courts understood that few
written instruments can anticipate every eventuality, and
that principals sometimes draft broad delegation language
to account for this. At the same time, courts appreciated
the corresponding risk that delegees could easily exploit
loose language in their commissions for their own benefit
and to the detriment of those they purported to serve. So
common-law courts often strictly construed delegated
powers, not because they were anti-delegee, but because
they were pro-principal.
The major questions doctrine performs a similar function.
Article I vests all federal legislative power in Congress. But
like any written instrument, federal legislation cannot an-
ticipate every eventuality, a point my concurring colleagues
have observed in the past. Id., at 781–782. And highly re-
sourceful members of the executive branch have strong in-
centives to exploit any doubt in Congress’s past work to as-
sume new power for themselves. The major questions
doctrine helps prevent that kind of exploitation. Our found-
ers understood that men are not angels, and we disregard
that insight at our peril when we allow the few (or the one)
to aggrandize their power based on loose or uncertain au-
thority. We delude ourselves, too, if we think that power
will accumulate safely and only in the hands of dispassion-
ate “people . . . found in agencies.” Id., at 781. Even if un-
elected agency officials were uniquely immune to the desire
for more power (an unserious assumption), they report to
elected Presidents who can claim no such modesty. See My-
ers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).
Another feature of our separation of powers makes the
major questions doctrine especially salient. When a private
agent oversteps, a principal may fix that problem prospec-
tively by withdrawing the agent’s authority. Under our
Constitution, the remedy is not so simple. Once this Court
reads a doubtful statute as granting the executive branch a
given power, that power may prove almost impossible for
Congress to retrieve. Any President keen on his own au-
thority (and, again, what President isn’t?) will have a
strong incentive to veto legislation aimed at returning the
power to Congress. Perhaps Congress can use other tools,
including its appropriation authority, to influence how the
President exercises his new power. Maybe Congress can
sometimes even leverage those tools to induce the President
to withhold a veto. But retrieving a lost power is no easy
business in our constitutional order. And without doctrines
like major questions, our system of separated powers and
checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual
and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.
That is no recipe for a republic.
This case offers an example of the problem. Article I
grants Congress, not the President, the power to impose
tariffs. Still, the President claims, Congress passed that
power on to him in IEEPA, permitting him to impose tariffs
on nearly any goods he wishes, in any amount he wishes,
based on emergencies he himself has declared. He insists,
as well, that his emergency declarations are unreviewable.
A ruling for him here, the President acknowledges, would
afford future Presidents the same latitude he asserts for
himself. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69. So another President
might impose tariffs on gas-powered automobiles to re-
spond to climate change. Ibid. Or, really, on virtually any
imports for any emergency any President might perceive.
And all of these emergency declarations would be unreview-
able. Just ask yourself: What President would willingly
give up that kind of power?
I recognize the concerns about the major questions doc-
trine. But it is not so novel as some have supposed. And it
serves Article I values we all share. My concurring col-
leagues all but endorse it today. I hope past skeptics will
give it another look.
