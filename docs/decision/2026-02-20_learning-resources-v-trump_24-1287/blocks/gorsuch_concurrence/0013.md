If the President’s claim fails under our usual major ques-
tions test, the dissent says we should respond by carving
out an exception to it for cases (like this one) touching on
“foreign affairs.” Post, at 45.
On this score, I share a limited point of agreement with
the dissent. Like the nondelegation doctrine, the major
questions doctrine protects Article I’s Vesting Clause and,
for that reason, the doctrine does not apply where the Pres-
ident is exercising only his own inherent Article II powers.
Like the nondelegation doctrine, too, the major questions
doctrine may speak with less force where the President and
Congress enjoy “overlap[ping] . . . authority.” See Gundy v.
United States, 588 U. S. 128, 159 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., dis-
senting); see also C. Bradley & J. Goldsmith, Foreign Af-
fairs, Nondelegation, and the Major Questions Doctrine,
172 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1743, 1747 (2004) (Bradley & Goldsmith)
(explaining the “supposed foreign affairs exception” to the
nondelegation doctrine “is better understood as a qualifica-
tion that concerns situations in which a statutory authori-
zation relates to an independent presidential power”).
Doubtless, cases implicating overlapping powers can
arise in the field of foreign affairs. The Constitution, for
example, vests in Congress the power to raise and regulate
armies, but it also vests in the President the commander-
in-chief power. Compare Art. I, §8, cls. 12–14, with Art. II,
§2, cl. 1. Similarly, Congress enjoys the power to regulate
foreign commerce, but the President has power to negotiate
treaties and nominate ambassadors. Compare Art. I, §8,
cl. 3, with Art. II, §2, cl. 2. The President may even enjoy
some “residual” powers pertaining to foreign affairs under
Article II’s Vesting Clause endowing him with the “execu-
tive Power.” See S. Prakash & M. Ramsey, The Executive
Power Over Foreign Affairs, 111 Yale L. J. 231, 234 (2001)
(Prakash & Ramsey); but see C. Bradley & M. Flaherty, Ex-
ecutive Power Essentialism and Foreign Affairs, 102 Mich.
L. Rev. 545, 551–552 (2004). Given all this, it is easy
enough to imagine statutes and disputes under them that
implicate both congressional and presidential powers
where we might have reason to question whether the major
questions doctrine applies with its usual force.
The problem for the dissent is that none of this is relevant
here. Before us, the President concedes that he does not
enjoy independent Article II authority to impose tariffs in
peacetime. Ante, at 18–19. Nor does the President claim
“‘concurrent’” constitutional authority to issue his tariffs.
Ante, at 13 (citing Tr. of Oral Arg. 70–71). Instead, and to
his credit, the President admits the power to authorize tar-
iffs in peacetime is constitutionally vested in “Congress
alone.” Ante, at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Therefore, the President relies entirely on power derived
from Congress, and that means the major questions doc-
trine applies in the normal way. See Bradley & Goldsmith
1796 (“IEEPA [is] not [an] authorizatio[n] that obviously
connect[s] to independent presidential power in ways that
would warrant the independent powers qualification”).
Because of this problem, the dissent must argue for a
much broader “foreign affairs” qualification to the major
questions doctrine. Rather than ask whether an independ-
ent, constitutionally vested presidential power is impli-
cated, the dissent would have us ask instead whether the
President seeks to use the statute in question for a foreign
affairs purpose—for example, as a “too[l]” to “incentivize a
change in behavior by allies . . . or enemies.” Post, at 50.
When he does, the dissent submits, the major questions doc-
trine should not apply. And that’s true, the dissent contin-
ues, even if the power the President asserts has “significant
domestic ramifications.” Post, at 51.
This new exception to the major questions doctrine would
have (enormous) consequences hard to reconcile with the
Constitution. Article I, §8, vests in Congress many powers
that touch on “foreign affairs.” Some of those powers were
expected to be (and are) the “principal objects of federal leg-
islation.” The Federalist No. 53, p. 333 (C. Rossiter ed.
1961) (J. Madison). They include not only the power to im-
pose tariffs, cl. 1, but also the power to establish uniform
rules of naturalization, cl. 4, appropriate money for armies,
cl. 12, and define and punish offenses against the law of na-
tions, cl. 10. Under the dissent’s view, all these legislative
powers and more could be passed wholesale to the executive
branch in a few loose statutory terms, no matter what do-
mestic ramifications might follow. And, as we have seen,
Congress would often find these powers nearly impossible
to retrieve. See Part I–C, supra.
Consider an example. Imagine Congress adopted a law
that arguably could be read to let the President borrow and
spend money during peacetime as he sees fit. A law like
that would represent an extraordinary delegation of Con-
gress’s power both to borrow “on the credit of the United
States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 2, and to spend money in support of
the “general Welfare,” §8, cl. 1, and would carry with it “sig-
nificant domestic ramifications,” post, at 51. But if an en-
terprising executive could also use the law as a “tool” for
affecting the behavior of “allies . . . or enemies,” the dissent
seemingly would have us exempt it from scrutiny under the
major questions doctrine.
The dissent’s exception is so broad it’s hard not to wonder
how it fits with some of our existing major questions prece-
dents. In West Virginia, the Court applied the major ques-
tions doctrine over a dissent expressing concern that doing
so would deny the EPA (and therefore the President) the
power to respond to “the most pressing environmental chal-
lenge of our time”—“[c]limate chang[e].” 597 U. S., at 753
(KAGAN, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).
A challenge, the dissent continued, that threatened conse-
quences global in scope, including “mass migration events[,]
political crises, civil unrest, and even state failure.” Id., at
754 (internal quotation marks omitted). Was West Virginia
a “foreign affairs” case? How about our major questions
cases addressing efforts to combat the global pandemic that
was COVID–19? See, e.g., NFIB, 595 U. S., at 114.4

4The dissent suggests that trying to identify when an independent Ar-
ticle II authority is in play would prove “jurisprudentially chaotic.” Post,
at 53, n. 23. But as the foregoing discussion illustrates, the dissent’s al-
ternative “foreign affairs” test poses its own challenges. And it seems to
me only one is firmly rooted in the text of the Constitution. See Bradley
& Goldsmith 1747; see also Prakash & Ramsey 233 (“[O]ne would think
that the Constitution’s text ought to play the preeminent role in discern-
ing the Constitution’s allocation of foreign affairs powers”). In this case,
too, only one test promises any manner of “chao[s]” because all parties
before us readily agree that the Constitution affords the President no
independent power to impose peacetime tariffs. See H. Powell, The Pres-
ident’s Authority Over Foreign Affairs: An Executive Branch Perspec-
tive, 67 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 527, 549 (1999) (“The President has no inde-
pendent power directly to regulate [or] tax . . . foreign commerce”).
Seeking support for its sweeping new exception, the dis-
sent points to three main precedents. Post, at 46–48, 53–
57. I do not see how any of them might sustain its view.
The first, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U. S. 507 (2004), con-
cerned the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force
(AUMF), legislation which authorized the President to use
“all necessary and appropriate force against those nations,
organizations, or persons” responsible for the September
11, 2001, attacks. Id., at 510 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The dissent highlights the principal opinion’s
conclusion that the AUMF allowed the President to detain
enemy combatants even though the law did not mention
that power expressly. Id., at 510, 516–517 (opinion of
O’Connor, J.). And from this, the dissent draws the infer-
ence that any statute addressing foreign affairs should be
exempt from scrutiny under the major questions doctrine.
Post, at 54–55. But the dissent overlooks the fact that the
principal opinion reached the conclusion it did only because
it found detention of enemy combatants to be a traditional
“incident to war.” 542 U. S., at 518. And once Congress
declares war (or, likewise, authorizes the use of military
force abroad), that implicates the President’s commander-
in-chief powers. Put simply, Hamdi was a case of overlap-
ping powers. Ours is not.
Second, the dissent invokes Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453
U. S. 654 (1981). See post, at 55–56. At its heart, that case
involved an executive order by President Reagan suspend-
ing certain claims by U. S. citizens against Iran as part of a
settlement involving the release of American hostages held
there. 453 U. S., at 675. Just as we do today, Dames &
Moore held that the “terms of the IEEPA . . . d[id] not au-
thorize” the President’s actions. Ibid. Even so, the Court
proceeded to uphold those actions anyway, and did so based
in part on its view (right or wrong) that the President en-
joyed some “‘independent’” power to “enter into executive
agreements” suspending certain claims. Id., at 678, 682–
683. So unlike our case, Dames & Moore again involved
overlapping powers. Along the way, too, the Court empha-
sized (repeatedly) the “narrowness” of its decision and that
it should not be taken to “lay down” any “general ‘guide-
lines’ covering other situations not involved here.” Id., at
661; see also id., at 660, 688. To derive from Dames &
Moore a new general guideline exempting “foreign affairs”
cases from the major questions doctrine’s reach would thus
require us to disregard its own cautionary direction.
Third, the dissent cites United States v. Curtiss-Wright
Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304 (1936). See post, at 46–48.
There, the Court did suggest that nondelegation rules in the
field of “domestic or internal affairs” should differ from
those in the realm of “foreign or external affairs.” Curtiss-
Wright, 299 U. S., at 315. But what should we make of that
language? If it means that the nondelegation doctrine (and
perhaps, by extension, the major questions doctrine) must
account for the President’s independent Article II powers, I
agree.
But I would hesitate to read more into the decision than
that. Consider what was really at issue there. A statute
permitted the President to ban the transfer of one class of
goods (armaments). Id., at 312. It did so with respect to
two countries then engaged in a war (Bolivia and Para-
guay). Ibid. The President’s authority was conditioned on
a finding that a ban “‘may contribute to the reestablish-
ment of peace between those countries.’” Ibid. Before mak-
ing that finding, too, Congress directed him to consult
“‘with the governments of other American Republics.’”
Ibid. All told, then, the statute set forth the policy for the
President to pursue. It bounded his authority by limiting
his options with respect to a limited class of goods and coun-
tries. The statute further conditioned his exercise of those
options on a factual finding reached after consultation with
other nations. So whatever else might be said about
Curtiss-Wright, one thing is apparent: In upholding the
President’s actions under the law in question, the Court
hardly allowed Congress to hand off all of its enumerated
powers touching on foreign affairs to the President, the tar-
iff power included.5
