My dissenting colleagues begin by taking the major ques-
tions doctrine as they find it. They accept that the Presi-
dent’s challenged actions are “of major economic and politi-
cal significance.” Post, at 33. They accept as well that he
must identify “clear” congressional authorization to sustain
those actions. Ibid. Still, the dissent maintains, IEEPA
clearly grants the President the tariff power he asserts.
To arrive at that conclusion, the dissent consults four
clues we have sometimes employed in our major questions
cases to help assess whether a statute clearly authorizes an
asserted power. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 746
(). The dissent formulates these
clues largely as I would. See post, at 35–38. But, to my
eyes, the dissent engages in a little grade inflation when
applying them.
First, is the President seeking to exercise an “unher-
alded” or “newfound” power based on a “long-extant” stat-
ute? Post, at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
dissent insists that is not the case here because President
Nixon imposed a 10 percent tariff on most imports in 1971,
and then defended that action in lower courts under a pre-
decessor to IEEPA, the Trading with the Enemy Act
(TWEA). Ibid. But the words “regulate . . . importation”
were added to TWEA in 1941. §301(1)(B), 55 Stat. 839.
Congress used the same language in IEEPA in 1977.
§203(a)(1)(B), 91 Stat. 1626. And in the 85 years of TWEA’s
existence with that language (and the 49 years of IEEPA’s),
that is the only time either statute has been invoked to im-
pose tariffs. Ante, at 10–11, 17–18. A single time, and one
never tested in this Court. Nor are these statutes seldom
used. “Each year since 1990, Presidents have issued
roughly 4.5 executive orders . . . and declared 1.5 new na-
tional emergencies citing IEEPA.” Congressional Research
Service, The International Emergency Economics Powers
Act: Origins, Evolution, and Use 20 (Sept. 1, 2025). That is
pretty strong evidence the President here seeks to “deploy
an old statute” in a novel way. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
747 ().
Second, how has the executive branch interpreted IEEPA
in the past? Post, at 40–41. The dissent says Presidents
have long understood IEEPA to permit them to impose tar-
iffs. Ibid. But for support, the dissent again relies on iso-
lated evidence about other statutes. It points to the mone-
tary exactions President Ford ordered under the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962. Post, at 17, 40. And, once more, it
points to President Nixon’s invocation of TWEA to support
his 1971 tariffs during lower court proceedings (though the
dissent brushes aside the fact that President Nixon initially
rejected the idea of relying on TWEA, see Brief for Carla
Hills et al. as Amici Curiae 12–14). Whatever one makes of
this history, it hardly reveals the kind of contemporaneous
and consistent executive interpretation that might advance
the dissent’s cause. See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 747
(). To the contrary, the fact that no
President until now has invoked IEEPA to impose a duty—
even one percent on one product from one country—is tell-
ing. Id., at 748.
Third, is there a “mismatch” between the action the exec-
utive official seeks to take and his expertise? Post, at 41.
On this one, I agree with the dissent. If tariffs fall in any
executive official’s “wheelhouse” (and not Congress’s), it’s
the President’s. Ibid.; see also supra, at 6.
Fourth, is the President “relying on oblique, elliptical, or
cryptic language”? Post, at 41–42. The dissent says no be-
cause “[t]his case does not involve elephants in mouse-
holes.” Post, at 41 (internal quotation marks omitted). Put
another way, the dissent insists, the provisions of IEEPA
before us are not “ancillary” ones, but are designed to con-
vey significant powers. Post, at 43 (internal quotation
marks omitted). It’s a fair enough point as far as it goes.
But our cases ask not just whether a provision is a “mouse-
hole” or “ancillary.” They also caution against reading ex-
traordinary powers into “broad or general” statutory lan-
guage. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 746 (GORSUCH, J.,
concurring) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Sossamon v. Texas, 563 U. S. 277, 291 (2011) (“[C]lear
statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or gen-
eral language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or
without due deliberation” (internal quotation marks omit-
ted)). Indeed, and as we have seen, many of our major ques-
tions cases have found broad or general terms in significant
statutes insufficient to support a claim to an extraordinary
or unusual power. See Part I–A, supra. And here, the word
“regulate” is broad as can be. So broad that it could be read
to “captur[e] much of what a government does.” Ante, at 14.
As I see it, then, three of the four clues the dissent relies
on cut against it. It is important to add, as well, that as
helpful as these clues can be in helping courts spot when a
claimed power is not supported by clear statutory authority,
they do not represent some exhaustive checklist, nor does
satisfying one guarantee a claim will succeed. So, for ex-
ample, even if an asserted power is in the agency’s “wheel-
house,” we might rule (and have ruled) against the agency
if the power is “unheralded” because the statute has stood
for decades without being interpreted to convey the power
claimed. See, e.g., Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 144,
159–160.
Ultimately, the central question in any major questions
case remains whether the executive branch’s claim to an
extraordinary power is supported by clear statutory author-
ity. And, as the principal opinion explains at length, many
additional clues beyond those the dissent addresses confirm
that the President cannot meet that standard in this case.
These additional clues include the way the key statutory
term “regulate” is used elsewhere in the U. S. Code, how
Congress has delegated tariff authority in the past, and
other neighboring language in IEEPA itself. Ante, at 14–
15.
Contrary to the dissent’s charge, too, the principal opin-
ion’s application of the major questions doctrine today in no
way amounts to a “magic-words test.” Post, at 44. Of
course, if IEEPA included terms like “tariff ” or “duty,” that
would have sufficed. But, to borrow a phrase from the dis-
sent, “monetary exactions on foreign imports” would have
worked just as well. Post, at 17. Same goes for “tax on im-
ported goods.” Or any similarly clear term or phrase. But
IEEPA includes no such language, just a broad term that
could cover almost anything a government does. And re-
quiring specific rather than general language is just how
clear-statement rules work. See, e.g., Sossamon, 563 U. S.,
at 291.
