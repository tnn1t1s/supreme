BARRETT who previously wrote that the major questions doctrine “grows
out of . . . commonsense principles of communication.” Biden v. Ne-
braska, 600 U. S. 477, 514 (2023) (same). And it was JUSTICE BARRETT
who used the various illustrations recounted above to suggest that our
major questions decisions can be explained by reference to the kind of
“common sense . . . that ‘goes without saying.’ ” Id., at 512. If JUSTICE
BARRETT now means to put all that to the flame, the major questions doc-
trine is better for it.
counseling “skepticism” of executive claims to extraordi-
nary delegated powers. Id., at 516. Why? Because,
JUSTICE BARRETT says, a “reasonable observer” consults
“our constitutional structure.” Id., at 515, 520. But if that’s
true, this version of common sense does require us to ac-
count for “values” entirely “external to a statute,” including
specifically the “substan[ce]” of Article I. Id., at 508. And
in so doing, this expanded version of common sense just be-
comes the substantive major questions doctrine by another
name.
Today’s decision illustrates the point. The principal opin-
ion gestures at “common sense.” Ante, at 8. But through-
out, this “common sense” is linked to “‘constitutional struc-
ture’” and “‘separation of powers principles.’” Ibid. The
principal opinion begins with the Constitution, observing
that Article I vests the tariff power in Congress, not the ex-
ecutive branch. Ante, at 5–6. The principal opinion re-
counts the President’s claim that Congress has “delegated”
an “extraordinary” amount of its tariff power to him in
IEEPA. Ante, at 8–9. And from there, the principal opinion
proceeds to apply a clear-statement rule. It acknowledges
that the ordinary meaning of the key statutory term in
IEEPA—the word “regulate”—is capacious, so much so that
it could be understood to “captur[e] much of what a govern-
ment does.” Ante, at 14. Still, the principal opinion rea-
sons, that is not enough to sustain the President’s claim be-
cause the statute does not “clear[ly]” grant him the
“extraordinary” delegated power he seeks. Ante, at 13, 20.
When it comes down to it, common sense serves as little
more than a segue to Article I’s Vesting Clause.
That is as it must be. The statutory terms contain no
ambiguity we could use (or need) “commonsense principles
of communication” to resolve. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514
(). This case is nothing like the
“‘drew blood’” illustration, where it might “‘g[o] without
saying’” that any ordinary person would immediately
understand which of two idiomatic meanings a penal stat-
ute employed. Id., at 512. Indeed, today’s principal opinion
does not even “attempt to set forth the metes and bounds”
of IEEPA’s key phrase “‘regulate . . . importation,’” ante, at
16, much less find the “best” or “most natural” meaning of
those words, Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 521 (BARRETT, J.,
concurring); post, at 1. Instead, we need go no further than
to recognize that IEEPA fails to “clear[ly]” authorize tariffs.
Ante, at 13, 20. And the only reason we can stop there is
because Article I—a “[s]ubstantive . . . valu[e] external to a
statute,” 600 U. S., at 508 ()—im-
poses a clear-statement rule when executive officials claim
Congress has afforded them an extraordinary authority.
There’s another problem too. The equivocation on
whether “commonsense principles of communication” in-
clude only those things that might “go without saying,” or
also include “external” and “substantive” Article I “values,”
leads to a further equivocation on how much “skepticism”
common sense might dictate when assessing an executive
official’s claim to an extraordinary delegated power. Com-
mon sense, we are told, does not impose a “‘clarity tax,’” but
it does add an “expectation of clarity.” Id., at 508, 514.
Common sense does not “‘loa[d] the dice,’” but it does coun-
sel “skepticism.” Id., at 510–511, 516. Common sense
means never “forgo[ing] the most natural reading of a stat-
ute,” post, at 3, but it always means “expect[ing that] Con-
gress [will] make the big-time policy calls,” post, at 2 (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted). I am uncertain what to make
of this, except that it seems to toggle between a clear-state-
ment rule and nothing at all.2

2 To the extent JUSTICE BARRETT suggests any skepticism “com-
monsense principles of communication” might (or might not) advise de-
rives from a “ ‘practical understanding of legislative intent,’ ” rather than
“external” and “substantive” Article I “values,” that poses still further
(and familiar) problems. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 515 (concurring
I am certain of one thing: Our cases hold a clear state-
ment is required to support a claim to an extraordinary del-
egated power. We required Congress to “speak clearly” in
Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324. We demanded “clear congres-
sional authorization” in NFIB, 595 U. S., at 118. We did the
same in Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 506, and in West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 732, and we do so again today, ante, at 13. Nor
do I see cause for being quite so reluctant about acknowl-
edging this. The common law recognized many clear-state-
ment rules. See, e.g., Part I–B, supra. Our own cases have
applied a host of Constitution-enforcing clear-statement
rules as well. We just encountered the federalism clear-
statement rule in Bond. Add to the list clear-statement
rules against laws that might apply retroactively, waive or
abrogate sovereign immunity, or create enforceable rights
under the Taxing Clause—to name just a few. See, e.g.,
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265–268
(1994); Financial Oversight and Management Bd. for P. R.
v. Centro De Periodismo Investigativo, Inc., 598 U. S. 339,
346–347 (2023); Medina v. Planned Parenthood South At-
lantic, 606 U. S. 357, 383–384, n. 8 (2025). Maybe all these
rules could be recast as “common sense”—at least if com-
mon sense means taking account of the “external” and

opinion) (quoting West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (2022)). Down
that road lies all the pitfalls associated with reliance on legislative his-
tory and those associated with conflating unenacted legislative intent
with the law. Scalia & Garner 397; post, p. 1 (JACKSON, J., concurring in
part and concurring in judgment). Similar problems attend the notion
that the appropriate degree of skepticism due a delegation might turn on
what people “expect.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514, 520 (BARRETT, J., con-
curring); see also post, at 2 (same). JUSTICE BARRETT has offered no evi-
dence about what people “expect” when confronted with different con-
gressional delegations. And to the extent she believes their
“expectations” would reflect an appropriate consideration of the whole
“‘corpus juris,’ including the Constitution,” post, at 2, n. 1, that just cir-
cles us right back to the “external” and “substantive” Article I “values”
she strives so hard to sideline, see Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508 (BARRETT,
J., concurring).
“substantive” “values” found in “our constitutional struc-
ture.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 515 (BARRETT, J., con-
curring). But whatever the label, it hardly requires some
“judicial flex,” post, at 4, to recognize that the “external”
constitutional “values” at stake in our major questions
cases are no less weighty than those at play in other set-
tings where we routinely apply a clear-statement rule.3
