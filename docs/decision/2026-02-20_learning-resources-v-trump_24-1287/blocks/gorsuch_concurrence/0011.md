That brings us to the third camp. My dissenting col-
leagues have defended the major questions doctrine in the
past, and they do so again today. Post, at 31–33 (opinion of
KAVANAUGH, J.). They agree that the doctrine is grounded
in the Constitution. Post, at 32. They agree that the doc-
trine requires us to deviate from “‘routine’” statutory inter-
pretation principles and instead place a “thumb on the
scale,” one requiring executive officials to identify “‘clear’”
congressional authorization when they seek to exercise
some “major” power. Post, at 33. But, my colleagues say,
IEEPA provides the clear statement needed to sustain the
President’s tariffs. Post, at 38–45. Alternatively, they sub-
mit, we shouldn’t apply the major questions doctrine to any
statute, like IEEPA, that implicates “foreign affairs.” Post,

3Notably, past critics of the major questions doctrine have not hesi-
tated to apply many of these clear-statement rules. See Financial Over-
sight and Management Bd. for P. R. v. Centro De Periodismo Investiga-
tivo, Inc., 598 U. S. 339, 346–347 (2023) (opinion for the Court by KAGAN,
J.); Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U. S. 369, 455–456, n. 1
(2024) (KAGAN, J., dissenting) (collecting examples); West Virginia, 597
U. S., at 751, n. 7 () (same). Nor have they hesi-
tated to adopt and apply other clear-statement rules with far less
grounding in the Constitution than the major questions doctrine. See,
e.g., Bowe v. United States, 607 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2026) (slip op., at 9–
10); id., at ___–___ (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12–15); Boechler
v. Commissioner, 596 U. S. 199, 208 (2022).
President large discretion in setting tariffs. Post, at 49–53.
Once again, the points are thoughtful and merit careful con-
sideration.
