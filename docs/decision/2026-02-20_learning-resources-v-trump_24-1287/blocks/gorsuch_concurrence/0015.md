That leaves one final camp to consider. JUSTICE THOMAS
suggests that Congress may hand over most of its constitu-
tionally vested powers to the President completely and for-
ever. Post, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion). On his view, the
only powers Congress may not delegate are those that in-
volve “rules setting the conditions for deprivations of life,
liberty, or property.” Ibid. From this rule, it follows that
Congress may give all its tariff powers to the President be-
cause “[i]mporting is a matter of privilege.” Post, at 10–11.
And, as a result, this case does not implicate any “‘“separa-
tion of powers”’” concerns at all. Post, at 3 (quoting ante,
at 8).
It’s a sweeping theory. One that would require us to
reimagine much of our case law addressing Article I’s Vest-
ing Clause. And one that presents difficulties of its own.
First, I do not see how JUSTICE THOMAS’s theory resolves
all “‘“separation of powers”’” concerns in this case. Post, at
3 (quoting ante, at 8). Suppose for argument’s sake that
Congress can delegate its tariff powers to the President as
completely as JUSTICE THOMAS suggests. Even then, the
question remains whether Congress has given the Presi-
dent the tariff authority he claims in this case—or whether
the President is seeking to exploit questionable statutory
language to aggrandize his own power. See Part I–C, su-
pra. Put another way, JUSTICE THOMAS’s nondelegation so-
lution does not automatically solve the major questions
problem. As we have seen, when an executive official
claims Congress has delegated to him some extraordinary
power, the major questions doctrine requires him to identify
clear statutory authority for its exercise—a standard he

reasons we have just seen. Even if the nondelegation doctrine should
apply differently when congressional legislation and executive actions
implicate inherent Article II powers, Gundy, 588 U. S., at 159, none of
that means it should do so where (as here) the President derives what-
ever authority he has only from Congress.
must satisfy even if Congress is free to pass to him the
power he seeks. Post, at 2–3. In fact, this Court has previ-
ously applied, with our colleague’s assent, the major ques-
tions doctrine in a case that appears, under his present
view, to involve a power that Congress could delegate
wholesale to the President. See Nebraska, 600 U. S., at
486–488 (involving the power to cancel federal student loan
debts, which on JUSTICE THOMAS’s account presumably
qualifies as a benefit or privilege, not a right to life, liberty,
or property). And, just as the major questions doctrine pre-
cluded the executive branch’s assertion of power in that
case, it does so here.
Second, even when it comes to the nondelegation doc-
trine, JUSTICE THOMAS’s theory raises many questions. I
appreciate that the doctrine may apply with less force in
certain areas, such as when Congress legislates in a way
that implicates one of the President’s inherent powers. See
Part III–B, supra; Gundy, 588 U. S., at 159 (GORSUCH, J.,
