Perhaps unsurprisingly given this history, American
courts applied the extraordinary power principle when
Congress and the States started delegating new regulatory
powers to executive agencies in the late 19th century. Take
railroad commissions. After the Civil War, governments
worried about the increasing power of railroad companies
responded by creating new agencies and imbuing them with
broad regulatory authority. These bodies were among the
first modern administrative agencies. See West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 740 (). And when they
claimed some extraordinary delegated power, both state
and federal courts enforced a clear-statement rule. See,
e.g., Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 213 U. S. 175,
193–194 (1909) (declaring, in the course of interpreting a
state statute, that an “enormous power” “must be conferred
in plain language” “free from doubt”); Board of R. Comm’rs
of Ore. v. Oregon R. & Navigation Co., 17 Ore. 65, 77, 19 P.
702, 707–708 (1888) (When an agency exercises “powers
delegated to [it] by the legislature” to carry out “important
functions,” the text must “define and specify the authority
given it so clearly that no doubt can reasonably arise”); ICC
v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co., 167 U. S. 479, 505 (1897)
(holding a delegation of legislative power of “supreme deli-
cacy and importance” must be “clear and direct”); Gulf &
Ship Island R. Co. v. Railroad Comm’n, 94 Miss. 124, 134–
135, 49 So. 118 (1908) (“It is universally held that a railroad
commission . . . must be able to point to its grant of power
. . . in clear and express terms, and nothing will be had by
inference”).
The railroad commissions may have been the first, but
they were not the last. Whether executive officials claimed
the power to criminally punish noncompliance with regula-
tions, force employers to retain employees regardless of
their unlawful conduct, or regulate intrastate candy sales,
this Court held them to much the same standard. Because
their claimed powers were so substantial, executive officials
had to identify a “distinc[t]” authority for them, United
States v. Eaton, 144 U. S. 677, 688 (1892), a “clear
legislative basis,” United States v. George, 228 U. S. 14, 22
(1913), a “definite and unmistakable expression,” NLRB v.
Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240, 255 (1939), or
a “clea[r] mandate,” FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312 U. S.
349, 351, 355 (1941). Cf. Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO
v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 645 (1980)
(plurality opinion) (“In the absence of a clear mandate . . .
it is unreasonable to assume that Congress intended to give
the Secretary [of Labor] the unprecedented power over
American industry” he claimed).
It is no mystery why the Court proceeded this way when
interpreting legislative directions to the executive branch.
Article I of the Constitution vests all federal legislative
power in Congress, and Article II charges the executive
branch with seeing that Congress’s laws are faithfully exe-
cuted. In a very real sense, then, when it comes to legisla-
tive power, Congress is the principal and executive officials
are the agents. See generally G. Lawson & G. Seidman, “A
Great Power of Attorney”: Understanding the Fiduciary
Constitution (2017).
So what is the basis for the charge that the major ques-
tions doctrine represents some “magica[l]” innovation? See
West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 779 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Part of the answer may have to do with the fact that, in the
latter half of the 20th century, this Court began experi-
menting with a very different approach. The Court pushed
aside its long-held skepticism of claims to extraordinary
delegated powers and began affirmatively encouraging
them. Chevron deference is just one example of this phe-
nomenon, though a stark one. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837
(1984). That case established a presumption that was
nearly the opposite of the major questions doctrine: When
Congress failed to speak clearly, courts put a thumb on the
scale in favor of delegated power. Id., at 843–844. Given
that development, the longstanding principles animating
the major questions doctrine may have receded from view
for a time. After all, the two doctrines often applied in the
same places and counseled opposite results. But with Chev-
ron gone, so is the conflict. This Court’s application of the
major questions doctrine is not invention so much as return
to form.
