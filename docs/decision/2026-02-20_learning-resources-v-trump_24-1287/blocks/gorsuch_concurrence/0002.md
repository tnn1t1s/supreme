Start with the critics. In the past, they have criticized
the major questions doctrine for two main reasons. The doc-
trine, they have suggested, is a novelty without basis in
law. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 779 (2022)
(KAGAN, J., joined by, inter alios, SOTOMAYOR, J., dissent-
ing) (calling the doctrine a “special cano[n]” that has “mag-
ically appear[ed]”). And, they have argued, the doctrine is
rooted in an “anti-administrative-state stance” that pre-
vents Congress from employing executive agency officials to
“d[o] important work.” Id., at 780. Today, the critics pro-
ceed differently. They join a section of the principal opinion
that applies the major questions doctrine. Ante, at 14–20.
And rather than critique the doctrine, they say only that it
is “unnecessary” in this case “because ordinary principles of
statutory interpretation lead to the same result.” Post, at
2–3 (opinion of KAGAN, J.).
