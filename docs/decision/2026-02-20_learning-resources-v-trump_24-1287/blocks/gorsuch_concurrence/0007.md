Turn now to the second camp. If some have criticized the
major questions doctrine, others have responded by seeking
to soften its blow. Though joining today’s principal opinion
holding that “clear” statutory authority is required to sus-
tain the exercise of an “extraordinary” power, ante, at 13,
20, JUSTICE BARRETT has suggested that the major ques-
tions doctrine might be reconceived. On her view, the doc-
trine need not be understood as a “substantive canon
designed to enforce Article I’s Vesting Clause”—a “valu[e]
external to a statute.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508, 510
(concurring opinion). Instead, the doctrine might be
thought of as a “commonsense principl[e] of communica-
tion” that counsels “skepticism” when executive officials
claim extraordinary powers derived from Congress. Id., at
514, 516; see also post, at 1–4 (concurring opinion).
It is a thoughtful effort, but I harbor doubts. For one
thing, there is no need to reconceive our doctrine; past crit-
ics all but apply the doctrine today and their previous criti-
cisms fall flat. See Part I, supra. For another, this gloss on
our major questions doctrine presents problems. Com-
monsense principles of communication do not explain many
of our major questions cases—this one included. And if
common sense really does go so far as to embrace a rule
counseling “skepticism” of claims by executive officials that
Congress has granted them extraordinary powers, that is
common sense in name only. The reason for such skepti-
cism must be Article I, a “substantive” source “external” to
any statute.
