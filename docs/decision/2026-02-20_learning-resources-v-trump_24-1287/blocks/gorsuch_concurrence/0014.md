If its effort to secure a broad foreign affairs exception to
the major questions doctrine won’t work, the dissent hints
at a more limited one specific to tariffs. Such an exception
makes sense, the dissent says, because “Presidents have
long been granted substantial discretion over tariffs.” Post,
at 52 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the dis-
sent contends, this tradition traces “back to near the Found-
ing.” Post, at 59. If the dissent were right about that, one
might hesitate before accepting the President’s concession
that this case does not implicate any inherent Article II au-
thority. But, at least as I read it, history offers the dissent
little to work with.
Americans fought the Revolution in no small part be-
cause they believed that only their elected representatives
(not the King, not even Parliament) possessed authority to
tax them. Declaration of Independence ¶19. And, they be-
lieved, that held true not just for direct taxes like those in
the Stamp Act, but also for many duties on imports, like
those found in the Sugar Act. E. Morgan & H. Morgan, The
Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution 72–74 (1995 ed.);

Nineteenth Century 60 (1903) (Stanwood); C. Van Tyne,

5In places, the dissent also argues that the President’s inherent Article
II authority includes a wartime tariff power. See post, at 22–24; see also
Brief for Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae 3. But this only
highlights the dissent’s bind. Whatever the full scope of the President’s
Article II war powers may be (and the briefs before us reveal a healthy
debate whether they include the power to impose tariffs), those powers
are not implicated here. IEEPA is not a wartime statute, nor does the
President claim we are at war with the countries whose goods are subject
to the tariffs.
The Causes of the War of Independence 126–136 (1922); J.
Otis, The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and
Proved (1764), in The Collected Political Writings of James
Otis 119, 161–162 (2015); see also id., at xii (Introduction).
Americans later codified these beliefs in the Constitution.
Under the Articles of Confederation, the national govern-
ment was laden with debt and enjoyed few ways to repay it.
To address that problem, the framers afforded the federal
government new taxing powers in the Constitution. Art. I,
§8, cl. 1. Many thought these powers among “the most im-
portant” features of the new federal charter. See, e.g., The
Federalist No. 33, at 202–203 (A. Hamilton). But, con-
sistent with their view that only the people’s elected repre-
sentatives could constitutionally tax them, the framers
gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.”
Id., No. 48, at 310 (J. Madison). And to cement that role,
the Constitution required that “All Bills for raising Reve-
nue shall originate in the House of Representatives,” the
body most responsive to the people. Art. I, §7, cl. 1.
For much of the Nation’s history, this taxing power was
essentially a tariff power. The framers even considered
(and eventually rejected) the possibility of giving the fed-
eral government the power to tax only through tariffs. The
Federalist No. 35, at 211 (A. Hamilton). No surprise, then,
that Congress’s first exercise of its taxing power was a tariff
law. P. Ashley, Modern Tariff History 170–171 (2d ed.
1910). And until the 20th century, tariffs “accounted for
between 50 and 90 percent” of the federal government’s rev-
enue. J. Dobson, Two Centuries of Tariffs: The Background
and Emergence of the United States International Trade
Commission 1 (1976).
How did Congress exercise its all-important tariff power?
It debated every detail of the first tariff Act. Stanwood 39–
71. Ultimately, Congress said, imported malt would incur
a charge of 10 cents a bushel. Brown sugar one cent. Loaf
sugar three cents. And so on. Id., at 59. The first tariff Act
was set to last for seven years. Id., at 72. It lasted barely
one. Ibid. Soon, Congress was at it again, laying out an-
other exacting schedule of duties. Id., at 75–76. Through-
out much of the 19th century, Congress proceeded simi-
larly, enacting highly detailed tariff schedules one after
another. See F. Taussig, The Tariff History of the United
States 68–170 (8th ed. 1931).
An early debate over executive involvement in setting
tariffs demonstrates just how strongly Congress felt that
tariffs were a legislative business. In December 1791, Pres-
ident Washington told Congress that General St. Clair had
been defeated in the Northwest Indian War, and the coun-
try would have to increase the size of the army. Stanwood
104. That meant the government needed more money. In
response, a resolution was offered in the House of Repre-
sentatives to solicit advice from the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, Alexander Hamilton, on the best way to raise the addi-
tional revenue—including through new tariffs. 3 Annals of
Congress 437 (1792); Stanwood 105–106. Ultimately, Ham-
ilton’s advice was sought, but only after a debate over the
constitutionality of even asking a member of the executive
branch for advice on raising revenue. Ibid.; 3 Annals of
Congress 447.
To be sure, on later occasions Congress turned to the ex-
ecutive branch for more help still. But it usually did so to
address changing trade practices in foreign countries. And
in doing so, Congress set the important policies, with the
executive branch responsible for finding facts—like what
other countries’ trade policies were at any given moment—
or filling in the details. So, for example, Congress passed a
statute in 1815 to repeal any “discriminating duty of ton-
nage . . . whenever the President” was “satisfied” that other
countries’ “discriminating or countervailing duties” had
“been abolished.” Act of Mar. 3, 1815, ch. 77, 3 Stat. 224;
see also, e.g., Act of Jan. 7, 1824, 4 Stat. 2–3.
Given this history, it’s no surprise that the dissent relies
mostly on statutes and cases after 1890. Post, at 59. But
even they do little to support its claim. J. W. Hampton, Jr.,
& Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394 (1928), for example,
involved a law instructing the President to “investigat[e]”
the costs of production for American firms and their foreign
counterparts and issue tariffs to “equalize” those costs. Id.,
at 401, 409 (internal quotation marks omitted). The statute
the Court faced in Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U. S.
649, 681 (1892), spoke similarly. Even when Federal En-
ergy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548,
came along in 1976, the Court upheld President Ford’s im-
position of monetary exactions on a single class of products
under a statute that provided at least some guidance about
how he should implement the law. Id., at 559. And whether
correctly decided or not, that case lies a far step from this
one.
Before us, the President insists he may use IEEPA to
equalize foreign and domestic duties—or not. He may use
it to negotiate with foreign countries—or not. He may set
tariffs at 1 percent or 1,000,000 percent. He may target one
nation and one product or every nation and nearly every
product. And he may change his mind at any time for
nearly any reason. At least as I see it, history dating “back
to near the Founding,” post, at 59, does not support the no-
tion that Presidents have traditionally enjoyed so much
power. More nearly, history refutes it.6

6Beyond the major questions hurdle, the dissent faces another, related
one: the nondelegation doctrine. There the problems are just as acute.
In recent decades, this Court has employed a relatively lax “intelligible
principle” test to police delegations. See FCC v. Consumers’ Research,
606 U. S. 656, 673 (2025); cf. Gundy v. United States, 588 U. S. 128, 157–
159 (2019) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (arguing for a more traditional test).
But recognizing that even the intelligible principle test poses challenges
for it, the dissent contends for an even laxer test yet in cases involving
“foreign affairs” and tariffs. Post, at 57–61. It’s an effort that fails for
