On his telling, the doctrine applies only to Congress’s true
legislative powers, which he says include only those powers
addressing the deprivation of life, liberty, or property. As
it turns out, only a small subset of Congress’s enumerated
powers in Article I, §8, fit that bill. See post, at 5–6 (listing
the powers to punish counterfeiters, tax “internal[ly],” and
regulate interstate commerce). Only those few powers are
exclusively vested in Congress and subject to review of any
kind under the nondelegation doctrine. All “other kinds of
power[s]” enumerated in Article I, §8—including the pow-
ers to borrow and spend money, declare war, and regulate
foreign trade—are not truly legislative and may be dele-
gated at will. Post, at 2. So Congress may hand them off to
the President completely and he has no need to worry about
legal challenges under even this Court’s (relatively lax)
nondelegation doctrine. No matter, too, that Congress
might find itself permanently unable to retrieve these pow-
ers. See Part I–C, supra.
But if all that’s true, what do we make of the Constitu-
tion’s text? Section 1 of Article I vests “[a]ll legislative Pow-
ers herein granted” in Congress and no one else. Section 8
proceeds to list those powers in detail and without differen-
tiation. Neither provision speaks of some divide between
true legislative powers touching on “life, liberty, or prop-
erty” that are permanently vested in Congress alone and
“other kinds of power[s]” that may be given away and pos-
sibly lost forever to the President. Post, at 2.
What do we make, too, of what the founders said about
Article I both before and after the Constitution’s ratifica-
tion? They regularly referred to powers in Article I, §8—
even those that do not touch on life, liberty, or property—
as legislative in nature. At the Constitutional Convention,
early drafts described the powers to regulate “foreign” com-
merce, “raise armies,” “equip Fleets,” “coi[n] . . . money,”
and “establish post-offices” as “legislative powers.” 2 The
Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 142–144 (M.
Farrand ed. 1966) (Farrand). James Madison wrote to Con-
gress in 1817 that “[t]he legislative powers vested in Con-
gress are specified and enumerated in the eighth section of
the first article of the Constitution.” 8 The Writings of
James Madison 386 (G. Hunt ed. 1908); see also 1 id., at
112, 133, 381 (noting, before the Constitutional Convention,
the “legislative power over captures,” and arguing borrow-
ing money is an “exclusive power of Legislation”).
Alexander Hamilton spoke similarly. 3 The Works of Al-
exander Hamilton 479 (H. Lodge ed. 1904) (Lodge) (discuss-
ing “[t]he legislative power of borrowing money”); 6 id., at
182 (describing “the legislative power of regulating trade
with foreign nations”); 2 id., at 197, 198 (calling of “the leg-
islative kind” and “of a legislative nature” the powers to
raise money and troops, “establish rules in all cases of cap-
ture by sea or land,” “regulate the alloy and value of coin,”
and “make all laws for the government of the army and
navy”). So did James Wilson. 1 Collected Works of James
Wilson 268 (K. Hall & D. Hall eds. 2007) (describing all the
Senate’s powers as “legislative powers,” with the exception
of the powers to try impeachments, concur in treaties, and
consent to the appointment of officers, matters addressed
outside Art. I, §8).
What do we make as well of early congressional debates?
In the Second Congress, for example, the House of Repre-
sentatives rejected on nondelegation grounds a proposal to
give the President a largely unfettered power to establish
postal routes, even though doing so hardly would have
touched on life, liberty, or property. 3 Annals of Congress
229–242. In the Fifth Congress, four Representatives like-
wise objected on nondelegation grounds to a bill that au-
thorized the President to raise an army of up to 10,000 men.
8 id., at 1525–1527, 1532, 1535 (remarks of Reps. Nicholas,
Gallatin, Baldwin, and McDowell). Though the bill ulti-
mately passed, see Act of May 28, 1798, 1 Stat. 558, it did
so apparently because it was deemed not to violate Article
I’s nondelegation principle—no Member of Congress re-
sponded that the principle was wholly inapplicable because
the delegated power was not one that involved setting con-
ditions for deprivations of life, liberty, or property. See 8
Annals of Congress 1525–1542.
What are we to do, too, with this Court’s nondelegation
precedents, which have never turned on JUSTICE THOMAS’s
view of life, liberty, or property? See J. W. Hampton, Jr., &
Co., 276 U. S., at 403, 409 (scrutinizing a delegation to ex-
ecutive officials to set customs duties); Panama Refining
Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388, 405–406, 422, 433 (1935) (hold-
ing unconstitutional a delegation to executive officials to
prohibit the transportation of petroleum products in inter-
state and foreign commerce); National Broadcasting Co. v.
United States, 319 U. S. 190, 196, 214–215, 225–226 (1943)
(scrutinizing the delegation of authority to regulate the
granting of broadcasting licenses); see also Sessions v. Di-
maya, 584 U. S. 148, 217 (2018) ()
(“[I]mpermissible delegations of legislative power violate
[the nondelegation] principle, not just delegations that de-
prive individuals of ‘life, liberty, or property’”).
Third, even if a distinction between true legislative pow-
ers and “other kinds of power[s]” were proper, post, at 2, I
do not see why the tariff power would fall in the latter cat-
egory and thus be something Congress could delegate away
wholesale, without scrutiny, and forever. JUSTICE THOMAS
suggests all that is possible because, at the founding, the
tariff power was considered a “‘prerogative right’” of the
British King. Post, at 11 (quoting N. Gras, Early English
Customs System 21 (1918)).
That seems doubtful. Tariffs may have been among the
King’s prerogative powers during the reign of Edward I.
See id., at 20–21; see also post, at 11, n. 3 (citing P. Einzig,
The Control of the Purse: Progress and Decline of Parlia-
ment’s Financial Control 65 (1959) (discussing the practices
“during the Middle Ages”)). But even before the year 1400,
Parliament had achieved some “victory over the King in the
matter of imposing import duties.” Id., at 108–109. And
after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, as this Court has put
it, Parliament “secured supremacy in fiscal matters.” Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau v. Community Finan-
cial Services Assn. of America, Ltd., 601 U. S. 416, 428
(2024) (citing 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 306, 333 (1771)). “By the time of the American
Revolution, trade regulation was thus a prime topic of leg-
islative concern” in Britain. M. McConnell, The President
Who Would Not Be King 217 (2020) (emphasis added); see
also J. Chitty, Law of the Prerogatives of the Crown 163
(1820) (“[T]he King does not possess any general common
law prerogative with respect to foreign commerce”).
More importantly still, whatever the views in Britain
may have been, American revolutionaries hardly shared
some universal conviction that all manner of tariffs were a
matter of the King’s prerogative, or even something Parlia-
ment, lacking colonial representatives, could freely impose
on them. Though in the mid-1760s some colonists distin-
guished between “‘internal’” and “‘external’ taxation” and
“conceded [Parliament’s] right to raise revenue through du-
ties on trade,” “the inadequacy of [that] much overstrained
distinction” soon “became obvious.” B. Bailyn, The Ideolog-
ical Origins of the American Revolution 212–213, 215
(1967). Illustrative of the point, John Dickinson came to
“repudiat[e]” the distinction “flatly and formally” in his Let-
ters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, id., at 215, contending
instead that laws aimed at raising revenue, but enacted
without representation, were objectionable without “dis-
tinction . . . between internal and external taxes,” Letters
From a Farmer in Pennsylvania 39 (1774). See also supra,
at 36–37 (recounting colonial objections to the Sugar Act);
H. Unger, American Tempest 101 (2011) (observing that the
“import duties” in the Townshend Acts helped “incite Amer-
icans to rebel”). And, of course, it was duties on foreign tea
that triggered the Boston Tea Party. J. Ellis, The Cause
17–18 (2021). Are we really to believe that the patriots that
night in Boston Harbor considered the whole of the tariff
power some kingly prerogative?
As we have already seen, too, the growing American con-
viction that the peacetime tariff power is legislative and be-
longs only to the people’s elected representatives was later
reflected in both the Constitution and early congressional
practice. See Part III–C, supra. To that discussion, I would
add just this. The Articles of Confederation granted the
Confederation Congress authority to make commercial
treaties, but no authority to restrain “the legislative power
of the respective states” to impose “imposts and duties on
foreigners.” Art. IX (emphasis added). At the Constitu-
tional Convention that followed, where the tariff power was
transferred to the federal government, delegates likewise
referred to it as a “legislative power.” See, e.g., 3 Farrand
615; 2 id., at 142–143. And, during debates over the Jay
Treaty, Hamilton explained that he held no doubt that reg-
ulating foreign trade and raising money from it was a “leg-
islative power,” if one that could be constrained by treaty.
6 Lodge 182, 189–190, 196. Reflecting the same sentiment
that helped fuel the Revolution, he asked: “[W]hat legisla-
tive power can be more sacred?” Id., at 196.

For those who think it important for the Nation to impose
more tariffs, I understand that today’s decision will be dis-
appointing. All I can offer them is that most major deci-
sions affecting the rights and responsibilities of the Ameri-
can people (including the duty to pay taxes and tariffs) are
funneled through the legislative process for a reason. Yes,
legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be
tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem
arises. But the deliberative nature of the legislative process
was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the
Nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people’s elected
representatives, not just that of one faction or man. There,
deliberation tempers impulse, and compromise hammers
disagreements into workable solutions. And because laws
must earn such broad support to survive the legislative pro-
cess, they tend to endure, allowing ordinary people to plan
their lives in ways they cannot when the rules shift from
day to day. In all, the legislative process helps ensure each
of us has a stake in the laws that govern us and in the Na-
tion’s future. For some today, the weight of those virtues is
apparent. For others, it may not seem so obvious. But if
history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will
come when those disappointed by today’s result will appre-
ciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.
