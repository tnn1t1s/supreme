The major questions doctrine teaches that, to sustain a
claim that Congress has granted them an extraordinary
power, executive officials must identify clear authority for
that power. Far from a novelty, much the same principle
has long applied to those who claim extraordinary dele-
gated authority, whether in private or public law.

Examples stretch across many fields. Consider first the
common law of corporations. In early modern England, cor-
porations could be formed only with “an explicit, ex ante
and direct authorization.” R. Harris, Industrializing Eng-
lish Law: Entrepreneurship and Business Organization,
1720–1844, p. 17 (2000). That authorization could be given
by the Crown, an Act of Parliament, or a combination of the
two. Ibid.; see also id., at 19. Some of these corporations
exercised regulatory functions not unlike those performed
by modern administrative agencies. M. Bilder, The Corpo-
rate Origins of Judicial Review, 116 Yale L. J. 502, 516–
517, 519–520 (2006). Indeed, the “[i]nitial settlements in
Virginia and Massachusetts Bay, among others, were struc-
tured as corporations.” Id., at 535.
English law treated these corporations as having author-
ity to issue bylaws. But that authority was subject to re-
strictions, one of which was that corporations could not reg-
ulate on major subjects without express authorization.
Take Kirk v. Nowill, 1 T. R. 118, 99 Eng. Rep. 1006 (K. B.
1786). That case involved the Company of Cutlers, a corpo-
ration for makers of knives and other cutlery. See id., at
118–119, 99 Eng. Rep., at 1006. An Act of Parliament gave
the company broad authority to regulate its members. Id.,
at 118–121, 99 Eng. Rep., at 1006–1007. The company used
that authority to adopt a bylaw allowing its officials to enter
its members’ “workshops and warehouses” and search for
“deceitful and unworkmanly” cutlery. Id., at 121–122, 99
Eng. Rep., at 1007. After the company seized supposedly
unworkmanly forks, the aggrieved owner challenged the
company’s actions in court, arguing that the bylaw under
which it acted was “bad in point of law” because the power
to incur a forfeiture was not “expressly given to [the com-
pany] by Act of Parliament.” Id., at 118, 122–123, 99 Eng.
Rep., at 1008. Applying a clear-statement rule, the King’s
Bench declared the bylaw, and therefore the seizure, un-
lawful. Lord Mansfield explained that the “power of mak-
ing bye-laws to incur a forfeiture” was an “extraordinary
power” over and above the default powers of corporations
“created by charter.” Id., at 124, 99 Eng. Rep., at 1009. For
this reason, the power needed to be “expressly given” by the
company’s progenitor, Parliament. Ibid. Since no such
power had been clearly conferred, the seizure was unlawful.
See ibid.
The same principle applied in American law. In In re
Election of Directors of Long Island R. Co., 19 Wend. 37, 40
(N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1837), a New York court addressed a case
involving 2,700 shares of stock in the Long Island Railroad
Company that the company had declared forfeited. Ibid.
All agreed that the company had broad power to regulate
its shares. See id., at 41–42. Still, the court called the for-
feiture an “extraordinary penalty,” and held that no such
power had been “expressly conferred” on the corporation by
its charter. Ibid. In fact, the court borrowed the clear-
statement rule from Nowill: If “extraordinary authority . . .
is intended to be given, it must be by express words to that
effect.” Id., at 43 (describing Nowill in detail).
The court in Ex parte Burnett, 30 Ala. 461 (1857), pro-
ceeded similarly. That case involved the incorporated town
of Cahaba, Alabama. See id., at 464. The town set the price
of a liquor license at $1,000, fined James Burnett for failing
to obtain one, and eventually imprisoned him for not paying
the fine. See ibid. Burnett sought a writ of habeas corpus
and argued that Cahaba had acted beyond the scope of its
corporate authority. Ibid.
Without a clear-statement rule, Burnett’s argument
would have stood little chance. That’s because the town’s
charter granted it the authority “to make and establish all
such rules, by-laws, and ordinances, respecting the streets,
markets, buildings, . . . and police of said town, that shall
appear to them requisite and necessary for the security,
welfare, and convenience of said town, or for preserving
health, peace, order, and good government within the
same.” Id., at 467 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
charter even specifically gave the town the “privileg[e] of
granting licenses for retailing of spirituous and other liq-
uors.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Semanti-
cally, the town’s power was broad indeed and encompassed
liquor licensing. But the court sided with Burnett anyway.
Reasoning that the town’s exorbitant licensing fee effec-
tively banned the sale of liquor, the court held that Cahaba
did not enjoy such extraordinary “prohibitory” power be-
cause it was “not authorized by any express grant of power”
in the town’s charter. Id., at 469; see also id., at 466.
These cases are not outliers. Treatises confirm that the
extraordinary power principle was fundamental to munici-
pal corporations. A statute could “not by implication invest
[a] body with any extraordinary authority.” J. Willcock,
The Law of Municipal Corporations ¶226, p. 99 (1827). Ex-
traordinary powers required “express words to that effect.”
Ibid. And “[a]ny fair, reasonable doubt concerning the ex-
istence of power [was] resolved by the courts against the
corporation, and the power [was] denied.” 1 J. Dillon, Com-
mentaries on the Law of Municipal Corporations 145 (4th
ed. 1890).
The takeaway is simple enough. Early corporations often
functioned much like today’s executive branch, exercising
delegated regulatory authority. And, when interpreting the
scope of that authority, the common law had a clear-state-
ment rule that looked strikingly like the major questions
doctrine.
Historically, a similar precept applied in agency law. As
the leading early American treatise put it, instruments con-
ferring powers of attorney were “ordinarily subjected to a
strict interpretation.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Law
of Agency 80–81 (2d ed. 1844). So, for example, in Attwood
v. Munnings, 7 Barn. & Cress. 278, 108 Eng. Rep. 727 (K.
B. 1827), a principal had delegated broad power to an agent
to act “generally for him and in his name,” including in all
things “as should be requisite, expedient, and advisable to
be done in . . . his affairs and concerns, and as he might or
could do if personally acting therein.” Id., at 279–280, 108
Eng. Rep., at 728 (internal quotation marks omitted). The
agent then accepted certain debts on behalf of the principal.
Id., at 280, 108 Eng. Rep., at 728. The question for the court
was whether this action was within the scope of the agent’s
authority. Id., at 281, 108 Eng. Rep., at 728. The court said
no. Powers of attorney are “instruments to be construed
strictly.” Id., at 283, 108 Eng. Rep., at 729. And the power
of attorney contained “no express power” to accept debts, so
no such power had been given. Ibid.
Other examples abound. A power to sell casks of whiskey
did not include the “unusual and extraordinary” power to
offer a warranty against future seizures of the casks, unless
granted by “express authority.” Palmer v. Hatch, 46 Mo.
585, 587 (1870). Under a power of attorney, authority to
enter contracts for a principal was subject to “strict inter-
pretation” and generally did not authorize “contracts of an
extraordinary character” outside those “connected with [the
principal’s] ordinary business.” Reynolds v. Rowley, 4 La.
Ann. 396, 398–399 (1849). And a power to manage a mine
did not authorize an agent to borrow money for the mine’s
operations on the principal’s credit because there was no
“express authority” for such a departure from the “usual
manner” of running a mine. Hawtayne v. Bourne, 7 M. &
W. 595, 599, 151 Eng. Rep. 905, 906 (Ex. 1841). This was
true even “in cases of necessity,” id., at 599, 151 Eng. Rep.,
at 907, where the manager borrowed funds to address an
“emergency suddenly arising,” id., at 600, 151 Eng. Rep., at
907.
Much the same principle applied to executive officials.
Often, “[t]he legality of an executive action depended on the
relationship between the size of the asserted power and the
clarity of the underlying legal authority.” T. Arvind & C.
Burset, Partisan Legal Traditions in the Age of Camden
and Mansfield, 44 Oxford J. Legal Studies 376, 388 (2024).
Entick v. Carrington, 19 How. St. Tr. 1029 (C. P. 1765), of-
fers an illustration. There, as part of an investigation for
seditious libel, the English Secretary of State claimed au-
thority to issue a warrant for the seizure of an author’s pa-
pers. Lord Camden declared the seizure unlawful, reason-
ing that power asserted by the executive “ought to be as
clear as it is extensive.” T. Arvind & C. Burset, A New Re-
port of Entick v. Carrington (1765), 110 Ky. L. J. 265, 324
(2022) (Arvind & Burset). Or, as another reporter described
Camden’s decision, “one should naturally expect that the
law to warrant [the exercise of power] should be clear in
proportion as the power is exorbitant.” 19 How. St. Tr., at
1065–1066. The seizure represented an extraordinary ex-
ercise of power, Lord Camden found, and no legal authority
clearly authorized it. See Arvind & Burset 324. Accord-
ingly, the warrant was unlawful and the seizure could not
stand. Id., at 332.
