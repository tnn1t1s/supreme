Unpack that last claim first. My concurring colleagues
contend that, as a matter of “straight-up statutory construc-
tion,” IEEPA does not grant the President the power to im-
pose tariffs. Post, at 7. In doing so, they make thoughtful
points about the statute’s text and context. But their ap-
proach today is difficult to square with how they have in-
terpreted other statutes. Dissenting in past major ques-
tions cases, they have argued that broad statutory language
granting powers to executive officials should be read for all
it is worth. Yet, now, when it comes to IEEPA’s similarly
broad language granting powers to the President, they take
a more constrained approach.
Consider some examples of how they have proceeded in
the past. Dissenting in National Federation of Independent
Business v. OSHA, 595 U. S. 109 (2022) (per curiam)
(NFIB), two of my concurring colleagues confronted a stat-
ute charging the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-
istration with promoting “safe and healthful working con-
ditions.” Id., at 127, 132 (joint opinion of Breyer,
SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ.) (internal quotation marks
omitted). They read that language as authorizing the
agency to impose a vaccine mandate on 84 million Ameri-
cans. Id., at 132; id., at 120 (per curiam). In support of
their reading, my colleagues stressed the statute’s “expan-
sive language,” another provision authorizing the agency to
issue temporary “emergency standards,” and “the scope of
the crisis” the agency was trying to address. Id., at 132, 135
(joint dissent) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Dissenting in Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Department of
Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. 758 (2021)
(per curiam), my colleagues addressed a statute permitting
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue reg-
ulations “necessary to prevent the . . . transmission . . . of
communicable diseases.” Id., at 768 (opinion of Breyer, J.,
joined by SOTOMAYOR and KAGAN, JJ.) (internal quotation
marks omitted). As they saw it, those terms granted the
agency the power to regulate landlord-tenant relations na-
tionwide during COVID–19. Ibid. In reaching this conclu-
sion, my colleagues again highlighted the statute’s “broad”
language and suggested that it permitted the agency to im-
pose even “greater restrictions” than the ones at issue in the
case. Id., at 769.
Dissenting in West Virginia, my colleagues faced a stat-
ute allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to en-
sure power plants employ the “best system of emission re-
duction.” 597 U. S., at 758 (opinion of KAGAN, J.) (internal
quotation marks omitted). They read that provision as au-
thorizing the agency to effectively close many power plants
and transform the electricity industry from coast to coast.
See id., at 754–755. In support, they once more argued that
the statutory language was “broad” and “expansive,” with
“no ifs, ands, or buts.” Id., at 756–758. They stressed, too,
that the relevant statutory terms appeared in “major legis-
lation” intended to address “big problems,” and that the
statute authorized actions in the agency’s “traditional lane”
or “wheelhouse.” Id., at 756–757, 765.
Finally, dissenting in Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477
(2023), my colleagues took up a statute permitting the Sec-
retary of Education to “waive or modify any statutory or
regulatory provision applying to [a federal] student-loan
program” during a national emergency. Id., at 533 (opinion
of KAGAN, J., joined by SOTOMAYOR and JACKSON, JJ.) (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted). They said that language
allowed the Secretary to cancel $430 billion in federal stu-
dent-loan debt because of COVID–19. See ibid.; id., at 501
(majority opinion). Once again, they argued that the
statutory terms were “broad,” “expansive,” “capacious,” and
designed to afford the Secretary a “poten[t]” power to re-
spond to “national emergencies” that were “major in scope.”
Id., at 533–542 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Now compare all that to how my colleagues proceed here.
This case, they say, is “nearly the opposite.” Post, at 3.
While straight-up statutory interpretation granted execu-
tive officials all the power they sought in all those other
cases, my colleagues insist this one is different because
IEEPA simply does not “give the President the power he
wants.” Ibid.
That’s a striking turn given the statutory terms before
us. When the President declares a national emergency “to
deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat . . . to the
national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United
States,” 50 U. S. C. §1701(a), IEEPA permits him to “regu-
late . . . importation . . . of . . . any property in which any
foreign country or a national thereof has any interest,”
§1702(a)(1)(B). Surely, the authority granted here is
“broad” and “expansive.” See West Virginia, 597 U. S., at
758–759 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). It has “no ifs, ands, or
buts” either. Id., at 756. As a matter of ordinary meaning,
the term “regulate” means to “fix, establish or control,” “ad-
just by rule, method, or established mode,” “direct by rule
or restriction,” or “subject to governing principles or laws.”
Black’s Law Dictionary 1156 (5th ed. 1979); see also post, at
4. And tariffs do just that—they fix rules that control, ad-
just, or govern imports of “property in which any foreign
country or a national thereof has any interest.”
§1702(a)(1)(B).
Without question IEEPA is also “major legislation” de-
signed to address “big problems” and “crises,” West Vir-
ginia, 597 U. S., at 754, 756–758 (KAGAN, J., dissenting)
(internal quotation marks omitted), along with “emergen-
cies” that are “major in scope,” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 542
(KAGAN, J., dissenting). By its terms, the statute applies
only during declared national emergencies involving
“threat[s]” to the “national security, foreign policy, or econ-
omy of the United States.” §1701(a). And it tasks the Pres-
ident personally with responding to those emergencies, a
responsibility surely more in his “lane” or “wheelhouse”
than that of any other executive official. See West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 765 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Notably, too,
IEEPA grants the President the power to impose even
“greater restrictions” than tariffs, Alabama Assn. of Real-
tors, 594 U. S., at 769 (Breyer, J., dissenting), because the
statute also permits him to “nullify,” “prevent,” and “void”
imports, §1702(a)(1)(B); see also Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 539
(KAGAN, J., dissenting).
Why do my concurring colleagues read IEEPA so much
more narrowly than they have other broad statutory terms
found in other major legislation addressing other emergen-
cies? They say contextual clues justify a narrowing con-
struction here. See post, at 3–7. But what the concurrence
calls “context” looks remarkably like the major questions
doctrine’s rule that, when executive branch officials claim
Congress has granted them an extraordinary power, they
must identify clear statutory authority for it. See ante, at
13 (reciting the rule).
Take some examples. The concurrence points to the “un-
paralleled authority” the President asserts “to impose a tar-
iff of any amount, for any time, on only his own say-so.”
Post, at 6. In other words, the President claims an
“[e]xtraordinary” power. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723
(majority opinion). The concurrence observes that no “Pres-
ident until now understood IEEPA to authorize imposing
tariffs.” Post, at 6. In other words, the power is an “unher-
alded” one. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 722 (internal quo-
tation marks omitted). Along the way, the concurrence also
adds “a modicum of common sense about how Congress typ-
ically delegates” and “consideration of whether Congress
ever has before, or likely would, delegate the power the
Executive asserts.” Post, at 2 (internal quotation marks
omitted). In other words, the statutory text must be read
in light of “separation of powers principles.” West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 723.
Having borrowed all those concepts from the major ques-
tions doctrine, the concurrence then turns to the key statu-
tory terms before us—“regulate . . . importation”—and ob-
serves that they “sa[y] nothing” (at least not expressly)
“about imposing tariffs.” Post, at 3. And why is that fatal
to the President’s case? Because the President is attempt-
ing to exercise the “‘core congressional power’” over taxes
and tariffs, a power Article I of the Constitution vests in
Congress alone. Post, at 5 (quoting ante, at 8); see also West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 737 () (ex-
plaining that the major questions doctrine “protect[s] the
Constitution’s separation of powers,” and particularly Arti-
cle I, which vests “all federal legislative . . . [p]owers in . . .
Congress” (internal quotation marks and alteration omit-
ted)).
If my colleagues all but apply the major questions doc-
trine today, maybe they are simply recognizing what they
have in other separation of powers cases involving the del-
egation of legislative power: that “[t]he guidance needed is
greater” when the executive branch seeks to take “action[s]
[that] will affect the entire national economy.” FCC v. Con-
sumers’ Research, 606 U. S. 656, 673 (2025) (opinion for the
Court by KAGAN, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). Or
maybe my colleagues believe the power the President as-
serts here outstrips even those powers executive officials
asserted in our past major questions cases. But whatever
the case, my concurring colleagues’ course today suggests
that skeptics owe the major questions doctrine a second
look.
All of which leads me to take up the challenges they have
posed to it in the past. Is the doctrine really some “special
cano[n]” that has only recently “magically appear[ed]”?
West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 779 (KAGAN, J., dissenting).
And is it really grounded in an “anti-administrative-state
stance” that prevents Congress from using executive
branch officials to perform “important work”? Id., at 780.
