Introducing her view that “commonsense principles of
communication” can sometimes help resolve disputes over
the meaning of statutory terms, JUSTICE BARRETT points to
an old chestnut. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512, 514 (concur-
ring opinion). Suppose a legislature used the phrase “who-
ever drew blood in the streets” in a criminal statute impos-
ing punishment. As a matter of “common sense,” JUSTICE
BARRETT says, it would “‘g[o] without saying’” that the law
doesn’t apply to a surgeon accessing a patient’s vein to save
his life. Ibid. That is because the phrase “drew blood” is
susceptible to two conventional idiomatic meanings: one
“applicable to violent encounters with man or beast” and
the other “to medical procedures,” A. Scalia & B. Garner,
Reading Law 357 (2012) (Scalia & Garner). And any
ordinary person faced with that phrase in a penal law would
find it obvious which meaning applies. Ibid.; see also Ne-
braska, 600 U. S., at 512 ().
The difficulty is, our major questions cases are different.
Often, little about them “‘goes without saying.’” Ibid. Take
FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120
(2000). There, the question was whether the FDA could
regulate tobacco products. Id., at 125. Looking only to com-
mon sense, the answer would have been yes. Congress au-
thorized the FDA to regulate “drugs,” which Congress de-
fined expressly and broadly as “‘articles (other than food)
intended to affect the structure or any function of the
body.’” Id., at 126. As a matter of common sense, nicotine
qualifies as a “drug” based on this statutory definition, as it
might even as a matter of everyday speech. West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 721–722 (noting the “colorable textual basis”
for the executive branch’s interpretation in Brown & Wil-
liamson). Still, we held the FDA could not regulate tobacco
products. Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–160.
Other cases follow suit. We have ruled that the term “air
pollutant” does not include greenhouse gases, even though
greenhouse gases pollute the air. Utility Air Regulatory
Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 316, 323–324 (2014). We have
held that the phrase “‘[r]egulations . . . necessary to pre-
vent the . . . spread of communicable diseases’” does not in-
clude eviction moratoriums, even without questioning that
eviction moratoriums were necessary to prevent the spread
of COVID–19, a communicable disease. Alabama Assn. of
Realtors, 594 U. S., at 761, 764. And we have said that clos-
ing coal power plants is not the “‘best system of emission
reduction,’” even while acknowledging that closing them
would reduce emissions. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 721,
732–735.
None of these cases can be readily explained by “com-
monsense principles of communication.” Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 514 (). None involved a
phrase like “drew blood” susceptible to two conventional id-
iomatic meanings, one of which any English speaker faced
with the law at issue might quickly rule out. Quite the op-
posite; in each case the agency had a strong argument that
the statutory language, commonsensically read, granted
the power it claimed. Meanwhile, all our major questions
cases can be easily explained by reference to a rule requir-
ing the executive branch to identify clear statutory author-
ity when it claims Congress has granted it an extraordinary
power. And that is a “dice-loading” rule, plain and simple,
one designed to protect Article I, a “[s]ubstantive . . . valu[e]
external” to the statutory terms at hand. Id., at 508.
Common sense not only fails to explain many of our major
questions cases. It doesn’t explain even some of the cases
JUSTICE BARRETT has held up as examples of commonsense
cases. In Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. 844 (2014), for
example, the Court confronted a statute that defined
“chemical weapon” to include “‘any chemical which through
its chemical action on life processes can cause death, tem-
porary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or an-
imals.’” Id., at 851; see also Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512–
513 () (discussing Bond). Despite
that broad definition, the Court held that “an arsenic-based
compound” didn’t fit the bill. Bond, 572 U. S., at 852, 866.
To reach that result, we did not use common sense alone.
How could we have? It hardly goes without saying that ar-
senic doesn’t qualify as a “chemical” which can cause “‘per-
manent harm to humans or animals.’” Id., at 851; see also
id., at 867 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (calling it
“beyond doubt” that the ordinary meaning of the relevant
statutory terms embraced the chemicals at issue). Instead,
we relied on a clear-statement rule grounded in the sub-
stance of the Constitution—namely, the federalism canon.
Id., at 860 (majority opinion) (“[W]e can insist on a clear
indication that Congress meant to reach purely local
crimes, before interpreting the statute’s expansive
language in a way that intrudes on the police power of the
States”). So Bond may well be like our major questions
cases, but that is only because it applied a clear-statement
rule grounded in another substantive feature of the Consti-
tution.
Consider as well the babysitter hypothetical JUSTICE
BARRETT has posed. Imagine a parent of young children
who hands a babysitter a credit card and says, “‘[m]ake
sure the kids have fun.’” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 513 (con-
curring opinion). Now suppose the babysitter takes the
kids on a road trip to an amusement park, “where they
spend two days on rollercoasters and one night in a hotel.”
Ibid. “Was the babysitter’s trip consistent with the parent’s
instruction?” Ibid. JUSTICE BARRETT believes the answer
is likely “no” as a matter of common sense. See id., at 513–
514.
Really, though, unless one is to believe children do not
“have fun” on rollercoasters and at hotels, the babysitter
hypothetical can be explained only with reference to some
“external” and “substantive” norm. Id., at 508, 513. And,
in fact, just such a norm is baked into the babysitter hypo-
thetical—one we encountered in Part I–B, supra. The
babysitter is exercising authority the parents have dele-
gated to her. She is acting as their agent. As a result, one
might expect a clear statement from the parents before the
babysitter may do something extraordinary, like take the
kids on a road trip.
This substantive norm about delegated powers not only
lurks beneath the surface of the babysitter hypothetical, it
“‘loads the dice’” against her. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 510
(). Doubtless, she would see it that
way. The babysitter would argue that a trip to an amuse-
ment park is “fun.” And she would be right under a com-
monsense understanding of the word. But because the
babysitter is exercising delegated authority, she cannot
exercise such an extraordinary power without clear author-
ization for it.
Notice, too, the same outcome is no longer guaranteed
when we remove the delegated power feature. If one parent
leaves the children with the other parent, the trip to the
amusement park might well be fine. No other contextual
clues are needed. See id., at 516 (agreeing with this). So if
the answer to the babysitter hypothetical seems a matter of
common sense to many Americans, that is only because the
substantive norms associated with parental delegations to
babysitter agents are so deeply rooted in our society. Say
the same instruction were given to a babysitter in a com-
munity where children are raised collectively, like a kib-
butz. Same answer? Hardly obvious.1
