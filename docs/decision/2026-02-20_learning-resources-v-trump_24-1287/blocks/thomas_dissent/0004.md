Neither the Legislative Vesting Clause nor the Due Pro-
cess Clause forbids Congress from delegating its other pow-
ers. As this Court put it two centuries ago, although Con-
gress cannot delegate powers that are “strictly and
exclusively legislative,” it can “certainly delegate” others.
Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 42–43 (1825) (opinion
for the Court by Marshall, C. J.).
Many of Congress’s powers fall within the core legislative
power subject to the nondelegation doctrine. For example,
the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate
commerce among the States. Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Congress can
thus make substantive rules for interstate trade—such as
by restricting drug shipments across state lines—punisha-
ble with fines or imprisonment. Cf. Gonzales v. Raich, 545
U. S. 1, 58 (2005) (). Likewise, the
Constitution gives Congress many other powers that impli-
cate life, liberty, and property, including the power to pro-
vide for the punishment of counterfeiting, Art. I, §8, cl. 6;
the power to provide for the punishment of treason, Art. III,
§3, cl. 2; and the power to impose internal taxes, Art. I, §8,
cl. 1; Amdt. 16. These powers cannot be delegated, as I have
repeatedly explained. See, e.g., Association of American
Railroads, 575 U. S., at 77 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); Whit-
man v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 487
(2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring). They cannot be delegated
even if Congress delegates them unambiguously. Cf. ante,
at 8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).
Congress also has many powers that are not subject to
the nondelegation doctrine. “We now think of the powers
listed in Article I, Section 8 as quintessentially legislative
powers, but many of them were actual, former, or asserted
powers of the Crown, which the drafters decided to allocate
to the legislative branch.” M. McConnell, The President
Who Would Not Be King 274 (2020) (McConnell); accord,
Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U. S. 1, 36 (2015) (THOMAS, J., con-
curring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). These
include the powers to raise and support armies, to fix the
standards of weights and measures, to grant copyrights, to
dispose of federal property, and, as discussed below, to reg-
ulate foreign commerce. Art. I, §8; Art. IV, §3. None of
these powers involves setting the rules for the deprivation
of core private rights. Blackstone called them “prerogative”
powers, and sometimes “executive.” See 1 Blackstone 242,
245, 255–262, 264–265, 276, 279; 2 id., at 407, 410 (1766);
1 W. Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History
of the United States 416, 421–425 (1953); McConnell 274–
275. By one count, 13 of the 29 powers given to Congress in
Article I were powers that “Blackstone described as ‘execu-
tive’ powers.” 1 Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution, at
428.
For most of American history, the nondelegation doctrine
was understood not to apply to these powers. Contra, ante,
at 42–46 (). “The early congresses
felt free to delegate certain powers to President Washington
in broad terms.” McConnell 333. Thus, the Constitution
gives Congress the power to support armies, Art. I, §8, cl.
12, but Congress in 1789 delegated to the President the
power to establish regulations for benefits to veterans
wounded in the Revolutionary War. See Act of Sept. 29,
1789, ch. 24, 1 Stat. 95. The Constitution gives Congress
the power to grant patents, Art. I, §8, cl. 8, but Congress in
1790 delegated to executive officials the power to grant pa-
tents in their discretion. See Act of Apr. 10, 1790, ch. 7, §1,
1 Stat. 109–110. The Constitution gives Congress the
power to borrow money, Art. I, §8, cl. 2, but Congress in
1790 delegated to the President the power to borrow up to
$12 million on behalf of the United States in his discretion.
See Act of Aug. 4, 1790, §2, 1 Stat. 139. The Constitution
gives Congress the power to raise armies, Art. I, §8, cl. 12,
but Congress in 1791 delegated to the President the power
to raise an army of 2,000 troops in his discretion. See Act
of Mar. 3, 1791, §8, 1 Stat. 223. And, as I explain further
below, see infra, at 13–15, the Constitution gives Congress
the power to regulate foreign commerce, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, but
early Congresses often delegated to the President the power
to regulate foreign commerce. See, e.g., Act of July 22, 1790,
ch. 33, 1 Stat. 137; Act of June 4, 1794, ch. 41, 1 Stat. 372.
These early delegations had one thing in common: They
did not implicate the Legislative Vesting Clause or the Due
Process Clause. “None of these statutes disturbed natural
rights or intruded into the core of the legislative power.”
McConnell 333; cf. A. Bamzai, Comment, Delegation and
Interpretive Discretion: Gundy, Kisor, and the Formation
and Future of Administrative Law, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 164,
178 (2019). They therefore did not violate the nondelega-
tion doctrine.
The Constitutional Convention seemed to agree with this
understanding of delegation. Contra, ante, at 42
(). James Madison proposed an
amendment clarifying that the President had the power “‘to
execute such other powers’” as were “‘delegated by the na-
tional Legislature,’” so long as the delegated powers were
“‘“not Legislative nor Judiciary in their nature.”’” 1 Rec-
ords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 67 (M. Farrand
ed. 1966). Thus, in Madison’s view, some of Congress’s pow-
ers were “not Legislative” and could be “delegated” to the
President. Ibid. Madison’s proposal was rejected after oth-
ers argued that it was unnecessary. Ibid. Madison agreed
that the purpose of the proposed amendment was only to
“prevent doubts and misconstructions.” Ibid. Nobody dis-
puted that Madison stated the correct scope of the nondele-
gation doctrine. Ibid.; see also McConnell 332 (“[W]e can
infer [from Madison’s motion] that the framers understood
that Congress would be able to delegate its royal preroga-
tive powers back to the President”).2

2Thus, although many used the word “legislative” in the broader sense
to describe powers that should initially belong to the legislature, ante, at
42–43 (), the Founders likely understood the
Legislative Vesting Clause to refer more narrowly to “core legislative
power,” Department of Transportation v. Association of American Rail-
roads, 575 U. S. 43, 80 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). That
understanding accorded with the views of separation-of-powers theorists
of the time, who distinguished the three core functions of government
from the institutions that would exercise them in any given polity. S.
Prakash & M. Ramsey, Foreign Affairs and the Jeffersonian Executive,
89 Minn. L. Rev 1591, 1612–1617 (2005); see 1 B. de Montesquieu, The
Spirit of Laws 151–153 (T. Nugent transl., rev. ed. 1899). For nondele-
gation purposes, therefore, “[t]he key is to distinguish between strictly
legislative authority—the power to make rules binding on persons or
