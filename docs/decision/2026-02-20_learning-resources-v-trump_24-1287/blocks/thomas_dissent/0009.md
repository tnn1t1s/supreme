Congress’s delegation here was constitutional. The stat-
ute at issue in these cases, the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, delegates to the President a wide
range of powers over foreign commerce. IEEPA gives the
President, on conditions satisfied here, the power to “regu-
late” foreign commerce, including “importation” of foreign
property. 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B).
IEEPA’s delegation of power to impose duties on imports
complies with the nondelegation doctrine. Congress dele-
gated to the President a version of the same power that it
has delegated to him in many statutes since the early days
of the Republic. See supra, at 13–17. Congress limited that
delegation to foreign commerce. See §1702(a)(1)(B); see
also §1701. In delegating the power to impose duties on
imports, it gave the President no core legislative power to
make substantive rules setting the conditions for depriva-
tions of life, liberty, or property. Its delegation therefore
complied with the constitutional separation of powers and
is consistent with centuries of practice and precedent. It
did not need to exercise that power itself and did not need
to delegate it “unambiguously”—even though, as JUSTICE

authorized duties to new ports. Id., at 193. Although the Court’s rea-
soning was somewhat opaque, the Court upheld the executive officials’
unilateral peacetime duties in part because nobody has a right to “intro-
duce foreign goods” except with the sovereign’s “expressed allowances.”
Id., at 196–197.
7In fact, less than a year ago, the Court explicitly rejected “a special
nondelegation rule for revenue-raising legislation.” FCC v. Consumers’
Research, 606 U. S. 656, 674 (2025).
KAVANAUGH explains, it did. See post, at 38–45 (dissenting
opinion).
The principal opinion bases its decision on the major
questions doctrine. Ante, at 7–13 (opinion of ROBERTS,
C. J.). In some cases, the Court has used the major ques-
tions doctrine as a canon of statutory interpretation be-
cause delegations of major powers are unlikely to be subtle.
See, e.g., Whitman, 531 U. S., at 468; see ante, at 8 (opinion
of ROBERTS, C. J.); see also Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S.
477, 501–503 (2023). In other cases, the Court has used it
to avoid what would have been originally understood as an
unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. See, e.g.,
West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723 (2022); ante, at 8
(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). In today’s cases, neither the
statutory text nor the Constitution provide a basis for rul-
ing against the President. I respectfully dissent.
