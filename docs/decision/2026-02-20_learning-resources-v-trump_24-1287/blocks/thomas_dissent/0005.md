As a matter of original understanding, historical practice,
and judicial precedent, the power to impose duties on im-
ports is not within the core legislative power. Congress can
therefore delegate the exercise of this power to the Presi-
dent.
A
Neither of the two constitutional foundations for the non-
delegation doctrine forbids Congress from delegating to the
President the power to impose duties on imports.
1
The Legislative Vesting Clause provides no basis for ap-
plying the nondelegation doctrine to the power to impose
duties on imports.
“The ‘power over external affairs [is] in origin and essen-
tial character different from that over internal affairs.’”
Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U. S. 255, 356 (2023) (THOMAS,
J., dissenting) (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-
port Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319 (1936)). Although internal
affairs are governed by the domestic law of one sovereign,
external affairs implicate the relationship between sover-
eigns, which is subject to the law of nations. See Locke
§§145–148, at 383–384; 1 Blackstone 264; 4 id., at 66–68
(1769); E. de Vattel, The Law of Nations 161–163, 281–289
(J. Chitty ed. 1852) (Vattel). External affairs, then, are not
susceptible to being “directed by antecedent, standing, pos-
itive Laws” made by one nation. Locke §147, at 384. When
a person goes abroad, he must resort to the political
branches (and ultimately the military)—rather than the ju-
diciary—for protection, can indebt the executive to foreign
nations for his personal misconduct, and can trigger a for-
eign conflict. See Vattel 161–163, 281–289; 2 F. Wharton,
——————
property within the nation—and other powers assigned to Congress.”
McConnell 327.
Digest of International Law §222, pp. 575–576 (2d ed.
1887); see also id., §§189, 213–221, at 432–445, 539–575.
The power to regulate external affairs was accordingly
not viewed as within the core legislative power at the found-
ing. See Zivotofsky, 576 U. S., at 35–37 (opinion of THOMAS,
J.). Blackstone described powers over “intercourse with for-
eign nations” as “prerogative” powers naturally belonging
to the King. 1 Blackstone 245; see id., at 232. Locke agreed
that this power “must be lodged” with the “executive.” Zi-
votofsky, 576 U. S., at 35 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing
Locke §148). Baron de Montesquieu classified all powers
“in respect to things dependent on the law of nations” as
part of “the executive power.” 1 The Spirit of Laws 151 (T.
Nugent transl., rev. ed. 1899). The “legislative” power, by
contrast, “applied only within the realm.” McConnell 214.
The power to regulate external affairs included power
over foreign commerce. At the founding, the “external ex-
ecutive power” included “‘the transactions of the state with
any other independent state.’” Zivotofsky, 576 U. S., at 36
(opinion of THOMAS, J.). In Great Britain, the King had no
unilateral legislative power, McConnell 107, but he had
much unilateral power over foreign commerce. His power
over foreign commerce included the power to “govern for-
eign trade,” id., at 216, and to “prohibit any of his subjects
from leaving the realm,” 1 Blackstone 261; accord, East In-
dia Co. v. Sandys, Skin. 223, 223–224, 90 Eng. Rep. 103
(K. B. 1684) (describing the “inherent prerogative in the
Crown, that none should trade with foreigners without the
King’s licence”). Thomas Rutherforth’s Institutes of Natu-
ral Law—“a treatise routinely cited by the Founders,” Zivo-
tofsky, 576 U. S., at 36 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)—explained
that the “external executive power” included “the power of
adjusting the rights of a nation in respect of . . . trade.” 2
Institutes of Natural Law 55–56 (1756); accord, Locke §146,
at 383. The power to impose duties on imports was a con-
ventional method for governing foreign trade. It originated
as a “prerogative right” of the King, N. Gras, Early English
Customs System 21 (1918).3
