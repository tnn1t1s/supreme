Historical practice and precedent confirm that Congress
can delegate the power to impose duties on imports.
1
Since the 1790s, Congress has consistently delegated to
the President power over foreign commerce, including the
power to impose duties on imports. “‘Practically every vol-
ume of the United States Statutes’” contains broad delega-
tions to the President in the area of foreign commerce. Id.,
at 80, n. 5 (quoting Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S.,
at 324).
The First Congress gave the President the power to “pre-
scribe” “rules and regulations” that would “gover[n]” any
person licensed to trade with Indians. 1 Stat. 137. Trade
with Indians was regarded as “a matter of external rela-
tions.” McConnell 333. In delegating this power, Congress
did not specify or limit what kinds of regulations the Presi-
dent could impose. Act of July 22, 1790, 1 Stat. 137–138.
Pursuant to that broad delegation, the President restricted
trading “[d]istilled [s]pirits,” required each trader to “give
intelligence” to the Government, and subdelegated to his
superintendents the power to “assign the limits within
which each trader shall trade.” 61 Timothy Pickering Pa-
pers, Massachusetts Historical Society 4 (Aug. 28, 1790);
see also Letter from G. Washington to H. Knox (Aug. 13,
1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington 244–245 (D.
Twohig ed. 1996). Any person who violated the President’s
regulations would owe $1,000 “payable to the President.” 1
Stat. 137.
Succeeding early Congresses delegated many more pow-
ers over foreign commerce to the President. In 1794, Con-
gress delegated to the President the power to “lay an
embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports of the United
States,” including ships belonging to Americans, unless
Congress was in session. Act of June 4, 1794, 1 Stat. 372.
It authorized the President to make “such regulations as
the circumstances of the case may require” in exercising
that delegated power. Ibid. Congress allowed the Presi-
dent to impose the embargo as “in his opinion, the public
safety shall so require.” Ibid. In 1795, Congress delegated
to the President the power to “permit the exportation of
arms, cannon and military stores, the law prohibiting the
exportation of the same to the contrary notwithstanding.”
Act of Mar. 3, 1795, ch. 53, 1 Stat. 444. In 1798, Congress
delegated to the President the power to discontinue “prohi-
bitions and restraints” on commerce with France. Act of
June 13, 1798, 1 Stat. 565–566; see also, e.g., Act of Mar. 3,
1817, ch. 39, 3 Stat. 361–362 (delegating to the President
the power to discontinue a ban on importation of plaster of
Paris). In 1799, Congress delegated to the President the
authority to discontinue and to reimpose “restraints and
prohibitions” on commerce with France when he “deem[ed]
it expedient and consistent with the interest of the United
States.” Act of Feb. 9, 1799, 1 Stat. 615. And, in 1800, Con-
gress delegated to the President the power to remove a ban
on trade with France, and to “re-establish” certain “re-
straints and prohibitions” when he “deem[ed] it expedient.”
Act of Feb. 27, 1800, 2 Stat. 9–10.4
Congress likewise delegated to the President the power
to set duties on imports. In 1815, Congress delegated to the
President the power to lower reciprocal duties when he was
“satisfied” that other nations’ trade practices no longer op-
erated “to the disadvantage of the United States.” Act of
Mar. 3, 1815, ch. 77, 3 Stat. 224. In 1824, Congress

bates,” ante, at 43 (concurring opinion), is thus difficult to reconcile with
what early Congresses actually did.
delegated to the President the power to lower and to reim-
pose duties in response to foreign nations’ trade practices.
See Act of Jan. 7, 1824, 4 Stat. 2–3. Throughout the early
decades of the Republic, Congress continued to delegate to
the President similar powers over duties on imports on a
regular basis. See, e.g., Act of May 24, 1828, ch. 111, 4 Stat.
308; Act of May 31, 1830, ch. 219, 4 Stat. 425; Act of July
13, 1832, ch. 207, 4 Stat. 578–579. Presidents frequently
changed the rates of duties on imports as to various foreign
nations pursuant to these delegations.5
