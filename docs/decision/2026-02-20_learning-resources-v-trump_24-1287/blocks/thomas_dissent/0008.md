This Court has consistently upheld Congress’s delegation
of power over foreign commerce, including the power to im-
pose duties on imports.
The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may “in-
vest the President with large discretion in matters arising
out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and com-
merce with other nations.” Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark,
143 U. S. 649, 691 (1892). Since shortly after the founding,
the Court has rejected challenges to delegations of power
over foreign commerce. See Cargo of Brig Aurora v. United

Messages and Papers of the Presidents 606–607 (J. Richardson ed. 1897)
(eliminating duties on “goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the
United States” as to the Free Hanseatic city of Bremen); see also, e.g.,
Aug. 1, 1818, Proclamation of President J. Monroe, in 2 id., at 607; May
4, 1820, Proclamation of President J. Monroe, in 2 id., at 642; Aug. 20,
1821, Proclamation of President J. Monroe, in 2 id., at 665–666; Nov. 22,
1821, Proclamation of President J. Monroe, in 2 id., at 666–667; June 7,
1827, Proclamation of President J. Quincy Adams, in 2 id., at 942–943;
July 1, 1828, Proclamation of President J. Quincy Adams, in 2 id., at
970–971; May 11, 1829, Proclamation of President A. Jackson, in 3 id.,

1004–1005; Apr. 28, 1835, Proclamation of President A. Jackson, in 3 id.,
at 1365–1366; Sept. 1, 1836, Proclamation of President A. Jackson, in 3
id., at 1452–1453; June 14, 1837, Proclamation of President M. Van Bu-

States, 7 Cranch 382, 386, 387–389 (1813). Even when a
“challenged delegation, if it were confined to internal af-
fairs, would be invalid,” the Court has upheld the delega-
tion. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at 315, 322.
There is a “fundamental” difference, the Court has ex-
plained, between “foreign or external affairs” and “domestic
or internal affairs.” Id., at 315. Thus, “Congress may of
course delegate very large grants of its power over foreign
commerce to the President,” Chicago & Southern Air Lines,
Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 109 (1948), in-
cluding when it comes to imposing “duties” on imports,
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S., at 325, n. 2.
When Congress has delegated to the President the power
to impose duties on imports, this Court has upheld those
delegations. In Clark, 143 U. S. 649, the Court upheld Con-
gress’s delegation to the President of the power to impose
duties on nations whose importation policies “he may deem
to be reciprocally unequal and unreasonable.” Id., at 680.
It explained that Congress had “frequently, from the organ-
ization of the government to the present time,” conferred
powers over “trade and commerce” to “the President.” Id.,
at 683. In J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276
U. S. 394 (1928), the Court upheld a delegation to the Pres-
ident to impose duties as necessary up to statutorily limited
rates to make them reciprocal. Id., at 401, 409. And, in
Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426
U. S. 548 (1976), the Court upheld a delegation of the power
to impose a universal duty on imported oil. Id., at 555, 558–
560.6

6The Court has even suggested that the President has inherent peace-
time authority to impose duties on imports. After the Mexican-American
War ended, executive officials imposed duties on imports at a California
port within the United States before Congress had “passed an act to ex-
tend the collection of tonnage and import duties to the ports of Califor-
nia.” Cross v. Harrison, 16 How. 164, 190 (1854); see also id., at 192,
194–196. The executive officials unilaterally extended Congress’s earlier
Although these cases involved duties on imports, the
Court nowhere suggested that a different nondelegation
rule applied because the duty was a “tax” or “raise[d] reve-
nue.” Ante, at 6 (majority opinion) (internal quotation
marks omitted).7
