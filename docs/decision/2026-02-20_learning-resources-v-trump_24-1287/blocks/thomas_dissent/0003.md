The Legislative Vesting Clause grants Congress alone
the federal legislative power. It requires that “[a]ll legisla-
tive Powers” granted to the Federal Government “shall be
vested in a Congress of the United States.” Art. I, §1. It
follows that those federal legislative powers cannot be exer-
cised by anyone else, including the President. See Associa-
tion of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 74 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.).
“Legislative power” for purposes of the Vesting Clause
means the power to make substantive rules setting the con-
ditions for deprivations of life, liberty, or property. I have
described this power as the “core legislative power” to dis-
tinguish it from other powers that the Constitution grants
Congress. Id., at 80. Core legislative power includes only
the power to make “law” in the “Blackstonian sense of gen-
erally applicable rules of private conduct,” the violation of
which results in the deprivation of “core private rights.” Id.,
at 73, 76. These core private rights are the natural rights
to life, liberty, and property. See 1 W. Blackstone, Com-
mentaries on the Laws of England 123–136 (1765) (Black-
stone); C. Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches,
107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 566–567 (2007).
The nondelegation doctrine is also rooted in the Due Pro-
cess Clause. That Clause prohibits the Federal Govern-
ment from depriving any person of “life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law.” Amdt. 5. The Founders mod-
eled it on chapter 39 of the Magna Carta, which prohibited
the deprivation of a free man’s private rights “except by the
lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land.” A.
Howard, Magna Carta: Text and Commentary 45 (rev. ed.
1998); see Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644, 723 (2015)
(). By the founding, the Magna
Carta was understood to mean that “no subject would be
deprived of a private right—that is, a right of life, liberty,
or property—except in accordance with ‘the law of the land,’
which consisted only of statutory and common law.” Asso-
ciation of American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 72 (opinion of
THOMAS, J.) (citing N. Chapman & M. McConnell, Due Pro-
cess as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1688
(2012)).
A rule made by someone other than the legislature, such
as the King, was not “‘the law of the land.’” Association of
American Railroads, 575 U. S., at 72 (opinion of THOMAS,
J.). Chief Justice Coke famously held invalid the King’s
proclamation prohibiting new buildings in London because
the King could not “create any offence” “without Parlia-
ment.” Case of Proclamations, 12 Co. Rep. 74, 74–75, 77
Eng. Rep. 1352, 1353 (K. B. 1611); see Association of Amer-
ican Railroads, 575 U. S., at 72 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (ex-
plaining that this principle was associated with chapter 39
of the Magna Carta). When the Founders transplanted the
same principle into the Due Process Clause, they ensured
that when the government wanted to deprive people of the
familiar core private rights of “life, liberty, and property,” it
could not do so “on the basis of a rule (or a will) not enacted
by the legislature.” Id., at 75–76.
