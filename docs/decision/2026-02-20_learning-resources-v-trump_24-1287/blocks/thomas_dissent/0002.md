The nondelegation doctrine is rooted in both the Legisla-
tive Vesting Clause and the Due Process Clause. The doc-
trine ensures that “[t]he Legislative [Branch] cannot trans-
fer the Power of Making Laws to any other hands.” J.
Locke, Two Treatises of Government §141, p. 380 (P. Laslett
ed. 1964) (Locke) (emphasis deleted). Importantly,
——————
Purpose of Revenue, is denied; a Right to regulate their Trade without
their Consent is admitted. The Imposition of a Duty, may, in some In-
stances, be the proper Regulation.” Considerations on the Propriety of
Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies 34 (2d ed. 1765) (emphasis de-
leted). Likewise, Benjamin Franklin famously conceded Britain’s “right
‘of laying duties to regulate commerce,’ ” but rejected its power to “ ‘lay
internal taxes.’ ” B. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Rev-
olution 214 (1967); see also id., at 212 (explaining that colonists denied
Britain “all right to tax the colonies,” but “conceded to it the right to raise
revenue through duties on trade”); E. Nelson, The Royalist Revolution
32 (2014); C. Becker, The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the
History of Political Ideas 90 (1922).
however, the nondelegation doctrine applies only to Con-
gress’s core legislative power, not to all of its powers.
