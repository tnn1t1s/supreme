The Due Process Clause likewise provides no basis for ap-
plying the nondelegation doctrine to the power to impose
duties on imports. The Due Process Clause protects
“rights,” not “privileges.” Gutierrez v. Saenz, 606 U. S. 305,
331 (2025) (). Importing is a matter
of privilege.
The government can charge money for privileges without
depriving a person of property for due-process purposes.
The government charges people money every day for a wide
range of activities, such as to enter a government park, mail
an envelope, apply for a copyright, or file a lawsuit. Be-
cause a person has no core private right to engage in these
activities, the government is not subject to due-process re-
straints in setting such charges. The due-process question
is not whether a government action “‘raise[s] revenue,’”
ante, at 6 (majority opinion), but whether it implicates core
private rights. Supra, at 3–4. Thus, when Congress dele-
gates power to make “regulations” on federal land, the Sec-
retary of Agriculture can set a “charge” for the “privilege of
grazing sheep” on that land without thereby “exercis[ing]
the legislative power.” United States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S.
506, 522–523 (1911); see also Bamzai, 133 Harv. L. Rev., at
180–182; contra, ante, at 8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.). Con-
gress has, consistent with due process, delegated the power
to set charges for a wide range of privileges. See 16 U. S. C.
§6802 (delegating the power to set fees for entrance to and

Parliament’s Financial Control 65 (1959) (“[T]he origin of the term ‘cus-
toms’ is that it had been the ancient customary practice of the Crown to
levy charges on imports and exports on its own authority”). Parliament
took some of that prerogative power away, but delegated it back in broad
terms to the King, see id., at 65–70, who was still agreed to have no leg-

use of federal recreation areas); 17 U. S. C. §1316 (delegat-
ing the power to “by regulation set reasonable fees” for ap-
plications); 39 U. S. C. §3622 (delegating the power to set
postal rates); 28 U. S. C. §1911 (“The Supreme Court may
fix the fees to be charged by its clerk”).
A person had no core private right to import goods at the
founding. On the Founders’ understanding, statutes allow-
ing “importation of goods from abroad were thought to cre-
ate mere privileges rather than core private rights.” Nel-
son, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at 580. Foreign commerce was
governed by the law of nations, which is a law of “sover-
eigns,” not of “private individuals.” Vattel 285. “[A]ny at-
tempt to introduce foreign goods” without the “expressed al-
lowances” of the sovereign was “a violation of its
sovereignty.” Cross v. Harrison, 16 How. 164, 196 (1854).
“Every state” had “a right to prohibit the entrance of foreign
merchandises,” including through the imposition of duties
on imports. Vattel §§90, 99, at 38, 43. Because “no one had
a vested right to import” any “goods from abroad,” the im-
position of “tariffs” as a condition for importing those goods
did not implicate the Due Process Clause any more than
when the government charges money for other privileges.
Nelson, 107 Colum. L. Rev., at 580.

The power to impose duties on imports thus does not im-
plicate either of the constitutional foundations for the non-
delegation doctrine. Hence, even the strongest critics of del-
egation, myself included, have recognized that regulations
of foreign commerce might not be subject to ordinary non-
delegation limitations. See FCC v. Consumers’ Research,
606 U. S. 656, 742, n. 19 (2025) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting)
(“[I]t may be . . . that tariffs and domestic taxes present dif-
ferent contexts when it comes to the problem of delega-
tion”); accord, Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S.,
at 80, and n. 5 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). So long as Congress
complies with other constitutional limitations, it can dele-
gate this power.
