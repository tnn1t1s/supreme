A
Shortly after taking office, President Trump sought to ad-
dress two foreign threats. The first was the influx of illegal
drugs from Canada, Mexico, and China. Presidential Proc-
lamation No. 10886, 90 Fed. Reg. 8327 (2025); Exec. Order
No. 14193, 90 Fed. Reg. 9113 (2025); Exec. Order No. 14194,
90 Fed. Reg. 9117 (2025); Exec. Order No. 14195, 90 Fed.
Reg. 9121 (2025). The second was “large and persistent”
trade deficits. Exec. Order No. 14257, 90 Fed. Reg. 15041
(2025). The President determined that the first threat had
“created a public health crisis,” 90 Fed. Reg. 9113, and that
the second had “led to the hollowing out” of the American
manufacturing base and “undermined critical supply
chains,” id., at 15041. He invoked his authority under
IEEPA to respond.
Enacted in 1977, IEEPA gives the President economic
tools to address significant foreign threats. 91 Stat. 1626.
When acting under IEEPA, the President must identify an
“unusual and extraordinary threat” to American national
security, foreign policy, or the economy, originating primar-
ily “outside the United States.” 50 U. S. C. §1701(a). And
he must “declare[] a national emergency” under the Na-
tional Emergencies Act. Ibid.; see 90 Stat. 1255. He may
then, “by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise,”
take the following actions to “deal with” the threat: “inves-
tigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regu-
late, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit,
any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, with-
drawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or
dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with
respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which
any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.”
§§1701(a), 1702(a)(1)(B).
President Trump declared a national emergency as to
both the drug trafficking and the trade deficits, which he
deemed “unusual and extraordinary” threats. He then im-
posed tariffs to deal with each threat. As to the drug traf-
ficking tariffs, the President imposed a 25% duty on most
Canadian and Mexican imports and a 10% duty on most
Chinese imports. 90 Fed. Reg. 9114, 9118, 9122–9123. As
to the trade deficit (or “reciprocal”) tariffs, the President im-
posed a duty “on all imports from all trading partners” of at
least 10%. Id., at 15045. Dozens of nations faced higher
rates. Id., at 15049. And these tariffs applied notwith-
standing any extant trade agreements. Id., at 15045.
Since imposing each set of tariffs, the President has is-
sued several increases, reductions, and other modifications.
One month after imposing the 10% drug trafficking tariffs
on Chinese goods, he increased the rate to 20%. See Exec.
Order No. 14228, 90 Fed. Reg. 11463 (2025). One month
later, he removed a statutory exemption for Chinese goods
under $800. Exec. Order No. 14256, 90 Fed. Reg. 14899
(2025). Less than a week after imposing the reciprocal tar-
iffs, the President increased the rate on Chinese goods from
34% to 84%. Exec. Order No. 14259, 90 Fed. Reg. 15509
(2025). The very next day, he increased the rate further
still, to 125%. Exec. Order No. 14266, 90 Fed. Reg. 15625,
15626 (2025). This brought the total effective tariff rate on
most Chinese goods to 145%. The President has also shifted
sets of goods into and out of the reciprocal tariff framework.
See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14360, 90 Fed. Reg. 54091 (2025)
(exempting from reciprocal tariffs beef, fruits, coffee, tea,
spices, and some fertilizers); Exec. Order No. 14346, 90 Fed.
Reg. 43737 (2025). And he has issued a variety of other ad-
justments. See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14358, 90 Fed. Reg.
50729, 50730 (2025) (extending “the suspension of height-
ened reciprocal tariffs” on Chinese imports).
