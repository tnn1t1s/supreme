The President asserts the extraordinary power to unilat-
erally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and
scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional
context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear
congressional authorization to exercise it.
IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate . . . importation”
falls short. IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties.
The Government points to no statute in which Congress
used the word “regulate” to authorize taxation. And until
now no President has read IEEPA to confer such power.
We claim no special competence in matters of economics
or foreign affairs. We claim only, as we must, the limited
role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution. Ful-
filling that role, we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the
President to impose tariffs.

6See, e.g., 453 U. S., at 660 (“We are confined to a resolution of the
dispute presented to us”); ibid. (We are “acutely aware of the necessity
to rest decision on the narrowest possible ground capable of deciding the
case”); id., at 661 (“We attempt to lay down no general ‘guidelines’ cover-
ing other situations not involved here, and attempt to confine the opinion
only to the very questions necessary to decision of the case”); ibid. (“[T]he
decisions of the Court in this area have been rare, episodic, and afford
little precedential value for subsequent cases”); id., at 688 (“[W]e re-em-
phasize the narrowness of our decision”). This is not quite “no, no, a
thousand times no,” but should have sufficed to dissuade the principal
dissent from invoking the case, see post, at 55–56, with respect to the
quite distinct legal and factual issues present here.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit in case No. 25–250 is affirmed. The
judgment of the United States District Court for the Dis-
trict of Columbia in case No. 24–1287 is vacated, and the
case is remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of ju-
risdiction.
It is so ordered.
