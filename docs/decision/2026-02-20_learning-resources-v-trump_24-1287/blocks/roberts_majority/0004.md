Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section
1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA—“regulate” and “importation”—the
President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs
on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate,
for any amount of time. Those words cannot bear such
weight.

Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution sets forth the pow-
ers of the Legislative Branch. The first Clause of that pro-
vision specifies that “The Congress shall have Power To lay
and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.” It is no
accident that this power appears first. The power to tax
was, Alexander Hamilton explained, “the most important of
the authorities proposed to be conferred upon the Union.”
The Federalist No. 33, pp. 202–203 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).
It is both a “power to destroy,” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316, 431 (1819), and a power “necessary to the ex-
istence and prosperity of a nation”—“the one great power
upon which the whole national fabric is based.” Nicol v.
Ames, 173 U. S. 509, 515 (1899).

1We agree with the Federal Circuit that the V.O.S. Selections case falls
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIT. The plaintiffs’ challenges
“arise[ ] out of ” modifications to the HTSUS. 28 U. S. C. §1581(i)(1).
Where, as here, such modifications are made under an “Act[] affecting
import treatment,” 19 U. S. C. §2483, they are “considered to be statu-
tory provisions of law for all purposes,” §3004(c)(1)(C). Thus, the plain-
tiffs’ challenges “arise[] out of [a] law of the United States providing for
. . . tariffs.” 28 U. S. C. §1581(i)(1). For the same reasons, the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction in
the Learning Resources case.
The power to impose tariffs is “very clear[ly] . . . a branch
of the taxing power.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 201
(1824). “A tariff,” after all, “is a tax levied on imported
goods and services.” Congressional Research Service
(CRS), C. Casey, U. S. Tariff Policy: Overview 1 (2025). And
tariffs “raise[] revenue,” West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,
512 U. S. 186, 193 (1994)—the defining feature of a tax,
United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22, 28, and n. 4 (1953);
Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, 514 (1937). In-
deed, the Framers expected that the Government would for
“a long time depend . . . chiefly on” tariffs for revenue. The
Federalist No. 12, at 93 (A. Hamilton). Little wonder, then,
that the First Congress’s first exercise of its taxing power
(and its second enacted law, right after the one providing
for the new officials to take an oath) was a tariff law. See
Act of July 4, 1789, ch. 2, 1 Stat. 24.
Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance, and
having just fought a revolution motivated in large part by
“taxation without representation,” the Framers gave Con-
gress “alone . . . access to the pockets of the people.” The
Federalist No. 48, at 310 (J. Madison); see also Declaration
of Independence ¶19. They required “All Bills for raising
Revenue [to] originate in the House of Representatives.”
U. S. Const., Art. I, §7, cl. 1. And in doing so, they ensured
that only the House could “propose the supplies requisite
for the support of government,” thereby reducing “all the
overgrown prerogatives of the other branches.” The Feder-
alist No. 58, at 359 (J. Madison). They did not vest any part
of the taxing power in the Executive Branch. See Nicol, 173
U. S., at 515 (“[T]he whole power of taxation rests with Con-
gress”).
The Government thus concedes, as it must, that the Pres-
ident enjoys no inherent authority to impose tariffs during
peacetime. Tr. of Oral Arg. 70–71. And it does not defend
the challenged tariffs as an exercise of the President’s
warmaking powers. The United States, after all, is not at
war with every nation in the world. The Government in-
stead relies exclusively on IEEPA. It reads the words “reg-
ulate” and “importation” to effect a sweeping delegation of
Congress’s power to set tariff policy—authorizing the Pres-
ident to impose tariffs of unlimited amount and duration,
on any product from any country. 50 U. S. C.
§1702(a)(1)(B).
