We have long expressed “reluctan[ce] to read into ambig-
uous statutory text” extraordinary delegations of Con-
gress’s powers. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 723
(2022) (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573
U. S. 302, 324 (2014)). In Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477
(2023), for example, we declined to read authorization to
“waive or modify” statutory or regulatory provisions appli-
cable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of
power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt. Id., at
494 (quoting 20 U. S. C. §1098bb(a)(1)). In West Virginia v.
EPA, we declined to read authorization to determine the
“best system of emission reduction” as a delegation of power
to force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal.
597 U. S., at 732 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §7411(a)(1)). And in
National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA, 595
U. S. 109 (2022) (per curiam), we declined to read authori-
zation to ensure “safe and healthful working conditions” as
a delegation of power to impose a vaccine mandate on 84
million Americans. Id., at 114, 117 (quoting 29 U. S. C.
§651(b)); see also, e.g., Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. 758, 764–765
(2021) (per curiam); King v. Burwell, 576 U. S. 473, 485–
486 (2015); Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324.
We have described several of these cases as “major ques-
tions” cases. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 505; West Virginia,
597 U. S., at 732; see also FDA v. Brown & Williamson To-
bacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 159 (2000) (citing S. Breyer,
Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin.
L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986)). In each, the Government claimed
broad, expansive power on an uncertain statutory basis.
And in each, the statutory text might “[a]s a matter of defi-
nitional possibilities” have been read to delegate the as-
serted power. West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 732 (internal
quotation marks omitted). But “context” counseled “skepti-
cism.” Id., at 721, 732. That context included not just other
language within the statute, but “constitutional structure”
and “common sense.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 512, 515
(). “[B]oth separation of powers
principles and a practical understanding of legislative in-
tent” suggested Congress would not have delegated “highly
consequential power” through ambiguous language. West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 723–724.
These considerations apply with particular force where,
as here, the purported delegation involves the core congres-
sional power of the purse. “Congress would likely . . . in-
tend[] for itself” the “basic and consequential tradeoffs,”
id., at 730, inherent in uses of this “most complete and ef-
fectual weapon,” The Federalist No. 58, at 359. And if Con-
gress were to relinquish that weapon to another branch, a
“reasonable interpreter” would expect it to do so “‘clearly.’”
Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514–515 ()
(quoting Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324).
What common sense suggests, congressional practice con-
firms. When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it
has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.
Congress has consistently used words like “duty” in stat-
utes delegating authority to impose tariffs. (A customs
“duty” is simply “the federal tax levied on goods shipped
into the United States.” Black’s Law Dictionary 638 (12th
ed. 2024).) See, e.g., 19 U. S. C. §1338(d) (“rates of duty”);
§2132(a) (“temporary import surcharge . . . in the form of
duties”); §2253(a)(3)(A) (“duty on the imported article”);
§2411(c)(1)(B) (“duties or other import restrictions”). It has
capped the amount and duration of tariffs. See, e.g.,
§1338(d) (50% cap); §2132(a) (15% cap, 150-day time limit);
§2253(e) (50% cap, phasedown requirement after one year).
And it has conditioned exercise of the tariff power on de-
manding procedural prerequisites. See, e.g., §2252 (inves-
tigation by the United States International Trade Commis-
sion, public hearings, report of findings and
recommendation); §§2411–2414 (investigation by the
United States Trade Representative, consultation with rel-
evant country and interested parties, publication of find-
ings).2
Against this backdrop of clear and limited delegations,
the Government reads IEEPA to give the President power
to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs. On this reading,
moreover, the President is unconstrained by the significant
procedural limitations in other tariff statutes and free to
issue a dizzying array of modifications at will. See supra,
at 3. All it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a
Presidential declaration of emergency, which the Govern-
ment asserts is unreviewable. Brief for Federal Parties 42.
And the only way of restraining the exercise of that power
is a veto-proof majority in Congress. See 50 U. S. C.
§1622(a)(1) (requiring a “joint resolution” “enacted into law”
to terminate a national emergency). That view, if credited,
would “represent[] a ‘transformative expansion’” of the
President’s authority over tariff policy, West Virginia, 597
——————
2The same is true of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,
76 Stat. 877, which we have held authorizes sector-specific import “li-
cense fee[s].” Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.,
426 U. S. 548, 571 (1976). Section 232(a) expressly references “duties.”
19 U. S. C. §1862(a); see infra, at 19. And Section 232(c) authorizes the
President to “adjust the imports” of an “article,” §1862(c), but only after
the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of De-
fense, conducts an investigation and prepares a report finding that the
“article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or
under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security,”
§1862(b).
U. S., at 724 (quoting Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324), and in-
deed—as demonstrated by the exercise of that authority in
this case—over the broader economy as well. See Congres-
sional Budget Office, CBO’s Current View of the Economy
From 2025 to 2028, p. 5 (Sept. 2025); Brief for Federal Par-
ties 2–3. It would replace the longstanding executive-legis-
lative collaboration over trade policy with unchecked Pres-
idential policymaking. See CRS, Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) and the Role of Congress in Trade Policy
(2015). Congress seldom effects such sea changes through
“vague language.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 724.
It is also telling that in IEEPA’s “half century of exist-
ence,” no President has invoked the statute to impose any
tariffs—let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope. Na-
tional Federation of Independent Business, 595 U. S., at
119.3 Presidents have, by contrast, regularly invoked
IEEPA for other purposes. CRS, C. Casey, J. Elsea, & L.
Rosen, The International Emergency Economic Powers Act:
Origins, Evolution, and Use 18–21 (2025). At the same
time, they have invoked other statutes—but never
IEEPA—to impose tariffs, on products ranging from car
tires to washing machines. See, e.g., Presidential Procla-
mation No. 8414, 3 CFR 115 (2009 Comp.); Presidential
——————
3Indeed, even before IEEPA was enacted, only one President relied on
its predecessor, the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), ch. 106, 40
Stat. 411, to impose tariffs—and then only as a post hoc defense to a legal
challenge. See Presidential Proclamation No. 4074, 36 Fed. Reg. 15724
(1971) (initially invoking the Tariff Act of 1930 and Trade Expansion Act
of 1962); United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 572 (CCPA
1975). Those tariffs were also of limited amount, duration, and scope.
See id., at 568–569, 577–578 (noting that the 10-percent surcharge was
described by President Nixon as “ ‘a temporary measure,’ ” was in effect
less than five months, applied only to “articles which had been the sub-
ject of prior tariff concessions,” and was capped at congressionally au-
thorized rates); Economic Report of the President 70 (1972) (“When all
exceptions to the 10-percent rule were taken into account, the effective
rate of surcharge came down to 4.8 percent”).
Proclamation No. 9694, 83 Fed. Reg. 3553 (2018). And
those tariffs did not “even beg[in] to approach the size or
scope” of the IEEPA tariffs at issue here. Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 502 (quoting Alabama Assn., 594 U. S., at 765).
The “‘lack of historical precedent’” for the IEEPA tariffs,
“coupled with the breadth of authority” that the President
now claims, “is a ‘telling indication’” that the tariffs extend
beyond the President’s “legitimate reach.” National Feder-
ation of Independent Business, 595 U. S., at 119 (quoting
Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Bd., 561 U. S. 477, 505 (2010)).
The “‘economic and political significance’” of the author-
ity the President has asserted likewise “provide[s] a ‘reason
to hesitate before concluding that Congress’ meant to confer
such authority.” West Virginia, 597 U. S., at 721 (quoting
Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 159–160). The Presi-
dent’s assertion here of broad “statutory power over the na-
tional economy” is “extravagant” by any measure. Utility
Air, 573 U. S., at 324. And as the Government admits—
indeed, boasts—the economic and political consequences of
the IEEPA tariffs are astonishing. The Government points
to projections that the tariffs will reduce the national deficit
by $4 trillion, and that international agreements reached in
reliance on the tariffs could be worth $15 trillion. Brief for
Federal Parties 3, 11. In the President’s view, whether “we
are a rich nation” or a “poor” one hangs in the balance. Id.,
at 2. These stakes dwarf those of other major questions
cases. See, e.g., Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 483 ($430 billion);
Alabama Assn., 594 U. S., at 764 (nearly $50 billion); West
Virginia, 597 U. S., at 714 (“billions of dollars in compliance
costs”). As in those cases, “a reasonable interpreter would
[not] expect” Congress to “pawn[]” such a “big-time policy
call[] . . . off to another branch.” Nebraska, 600 U. S., at
515 ().
The Government and the principal dissent attempt to
avoid application of the major questions doctrine on several
grounds. None is convincing.
The Government argues first that the doctrine should not
apply to emergency statutes. Brief for Federal Parties 35–
36. But this argument is nearly identical to one it already
advanced in Nebraska. There, the Government contended
that a different emergency statute should be interpreted
broadly because its “whole point” was to provide “substan-
tial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies.”
600 U. S., at 500 (internal quotation marks omitted). We
rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here
as well. “Emergency powers,” after all, “tend to kindle
emergencies.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343
U. S. 579, 650 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). Dozens of
IEEPA emergencies remain ongoing today, including the
first—declared over four decades ago in response to the Ira-
nian hostage crisis. CRS, Casey, International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, at 20. And as the Framers under-
stood, emergencies can “afford a ready pretext for usurpa-
tion” of congressional power. Youngstown, 343 U. S., at 650
(Jackson, J., concurring). Where Congress has reason to be
worried about its powers “slipping through its fingers,” id.,
at 654, we in turn have every reason to expect Congress to
use clear language to effectuate unbounded delegations—
particularly of its “one great power,” Nicol, 173 U. S., at
515.
The Government’s and the principal dissent’s proposed
foreign affairs exception fares no better. Brief for Federal
Parties 34–35; post, at 45–57 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).
As a general matter, the President of course enjoys some
“independent constitutional power[s]” over foreign affairs
“even without congressional authorization.” FCC v. Con-
sumers’ Research, 606 U. S. 656, 707 (2025) (KAVANAUGH,
J., concurring). And Congress certainly may intend to “give
the President substantial authority and flexibility” in many
foreign affairs or national security contexts. Post, at 48
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (quoting Consumers’ Research,
606 U. S., at 706 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring)). But
“flip[ping]” the “presumption” under the major questions
doctrine, Brief for Federal Parties 34, makes little sense
when it comes to tariffs. As the Government admits, the
President and Congress do not “enjoy concurrent constitu-
tional authority” to impose tariffs during peacetime. Ibid.;
Tr. of Oral Arg. 70–71. The Framers gave that power to
“Congress alone”—notwithstanding the obvious foreign af-
fairs implications of tariffs. Merritt v. Welsh, 104 U. S. 694,
700 (1882). And whatever may be said of other powers that
implicate foreign affairs, we would not expect Congress to
relinquish its tariff power through vague language, or with-
out careful limits.
The central thrust of the Government’s and the principal
dissent’s proposed exceptions appears to be that ambiguous
delegations in statutes addressing “the most major of major
questions” should necessarily be construed broadly. Brief
for Federal Parties 35. But it simply does not follow from
the fact that a statute deals with major problems that it
should be read to delegate all major powers for which there
may be a “colorable textual basis.” West Virginia, 597 U. S.,
at 722. It is in precisely such cases that we should be alert
to claims that sweeping delegations—particularly delega-
tions of core congressional powers—“lurk[]” in “ambiguous
statutory text.” Id., at 723 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). There is no major questions exception to the major
questions doctrine.
Accordingly, the President must “point to clear congres-
sional authorization” to justify his extraordinary assertion
of the power to impose tariffs. Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 506
(internal quotation marks omitted). He cannot.
