Petitioners in Learning Resources and respondents in
V.O.S. Selections filed suit, alleging that IEEPA does not
authorize the reciprocal or drug trafficking tariffs. The
Learning Resources plaintiffs—two small businesses—sued
in the United States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia. The V.O.S. Selections plaintiffs—five small busi-
nesses and 12 States—sued in the United States Court of
International Trade (CIT).
The Government moved to transfer the Learning Re-
sources case to the CIT. It argued that the District Court
lacked jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1581(i)(1), which
gives the CIT “exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action com-
menced against” the Government “that arises out of any
law of the United States providing for . . . tariffs” or their
“administration and enforcement.” The District Court de-
nied that motion and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for a
preliminary injunction, concluding that IEEPA did not
grant the President the power to impose tariffs. 784
F. Supp. 3d 209 (DC 2025).
In the V.O.S. Selections case, the CIT granted the plain-
tiffs’ motion for summary judgment. 772 F. Supp. 3d 1350
(2025). The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed in
relevant part. 149 F. 4th 1312 (2025). It first concluded
that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction because the plain-
tiffs’ claims arose out of modifications to the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Id., at 1329.
On the merits, it agreed with the CIT that IEEPA’s grant
of authority to “regulate . . . importation” did not authorize
the challenged tariffs, which “are unbounded in scope,
amount, and duration.” Id., at 1338. Judge Cunningham
concurred (for four judges), reasoning that IEEPA did not
authorize the President to impose any tariffs. Id., at 1340.
Judge Taranto dissented (for four judges), concluding that
IEEPA authorized the challenged tariffs. Id., at 1348.
The Government filed a motion to expedite and a petition
for certiorari in V.O.S. Selections, and the Learning Re-
sources plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari before
judgment. We granted the motion and petitions and con-
solidated the cases. 606 U. S. 1050 (2025).1
