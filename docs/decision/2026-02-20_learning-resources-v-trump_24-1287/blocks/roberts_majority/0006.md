To begin, IEEPA authorizes the President to “investigate,
block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, di-
rect and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit . . . impor-
tation or exportation.” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B). Absent
from this lengthy list of powers is any mention of tariffs or
duties. That omission is notable in light of the significant
but specific powers Congress did go to the trouble of nam-
ing. It stands to reason that had Congress intended to con-
vey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs,
it would have done so expressly—as it consistently has in
other tariff statutes. See supra, at 8; accord, post, at 11, 26–
27 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).
The power to “regulate . . . importation” does not fill that
void. “Regulate,” as that term is ordinarily used, means to
“fix, establish, or control; to adjust by rule, method, or es-
tablished mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to
governing principles or laws.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1156
(5th ed. 1979); see also Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596
U. S. 685, 697 (2022). This definition captures much of
what a government does on a day-to-day basis. Indeed, if
“regulate” is as broad as the principal dissent suggests,
post, at 10–11, then the other eight verbs in §1702(a)(1)(B)
are simply wasted ink. But the facial breadth of “regulate”
places in stark relief what the term is not usually thought
to include: taxation. The U. S. Code is replete with statutes
granting the Executive the authority to “regulate” someone
or something. Yet the Government cannot identify any
statute in which the power to regulate includes the power
to tax. The Government concedes, for example, that the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission cannot tax the trading
of securities, even though it is expressly authorized to “reg-
ulate the trading of . . . securities.” 15 U. S. C. §78i(h)(1);
see Brief for Federal Parties 31–32. We are therefore skep-
tical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a
delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotid-
ian power to “regulate.”
Taxes, to be sure, may accomplish regulatory ends. See
Sonzinsky, 300 U. S., at 513; Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 201–
202. But it does not follow that the power to regulate some-
thing includes the power to tax it as a means of regulation.
Congressional practice suggests as much. When Congress
addresses both the power to regulate and the power to tax,
it does so separately and expressly. See, e.g., 16 U. S. C.
§460bbb–9(a) (distinguishing between the power to “tax
persons, franchise, or private property” on lands and the
power “to regulate the private lands”); 2 U. S. C.
§622(8)(B)(i) (“government-sponsored enterprise” does not
have the “power to tax or to regulate interstate commerce”).
That is unsurprising, as the “power to regulate commerce”
is “entirely distinct from the right to levy taxes.” Gibbons,
9 Wheat., at 201. That Congress did not grant those au-
thorities separately here is strong evidence that “regulate”
in IEEPA does not include taxation.
A contrary reading would render IEEPA partly unconsti-
tutional. IEEPA authorizes the President to “regulate . . .
importation or exportation.” 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B) (em-
phasis added). Taxing exports, however, is expressly for-
bidden by the Constitution. Art. I, §9, cl. 5.
The “neighboring words” with which “regulate” “is asso-
ciated” also suggest that Congress did not intend for “regu-
late” to include the revenue-raising power. United States v.
Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008). “Regulate” is one of
nine verbs listed in §1702(a)(1)(B). Each authorizes a dis-
tinct action a President might take in sanctioning foreign
actors or controlling domestic actors engaged in foreign
commerce—blocking imports, for example, or prohibiting
transactions. Presidential practice under IEEPA demon-
strates as much. See CRS, Casey, International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, at 79–106 (Table A–3); see, e.g., Exec.
Order No. 13194, 3 CFR 741 (2001 Comp.) (blocking
importation of diamonds from insurgent regime in Sierra
Leone); Exec. Order No. 12947, 3 CFR 319 (1995 Comp.)
(prohibiting transactions with those “who threaten to dis-
rupt the Middle East peace process”). None of IEEPA’s au-
thorities includes the distinct and extraordinary power to
raise revenue. And the fact that no President has ever
found such power in IEEPA is strong evidence that it does
not exist. See supra, at 10; FTC v. Bunte Brothers, Inc., 312
U. S. 349, 351–352 (1941).
We do not attempt to set forth the metes and bounds of
the President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation” un-
der IEEPA. That “interpretive question” is “not at issue” in
this case, and any answer would be “plain dicta.” West Vir-
ginia, 597 U. S., at 734–735, and n. 5. Our task today is to
decide only whether the power to “regulate . . . importa-
tion,” as granted to the President in IEEPA, embraces the
power to impose tariffs. It does not.4
The Government, echoed point-for-point by the principal
dissent, marshals several arguments in response. First, it
contends that IEEPA confers the power to impose tariffs be-
cause early commentators and this Court’s cases discuss
tariffs in the context of the Constitution’s Commerce
Clause. See Brief for Federal Parties 24–25; post, at 12–13
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). But that answers the wrong
question. The question is not, as the Government would
have it, whether tariffs can ever be a means of regulating
commerce. It is instead whether Congress, when conferring
the power to “regulate . . . importation,” gave the President
the power to impose tariffs at his sole discretion. And

4The principal dissent surmises that the President could impose “most
if not all” of the tariffs at issue under statutes other than IEEPA. Post,
at 62 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). The cited statutes contain various com-
binations of procedural prerequisites, required agency determinations,
and limits on the duration, amount, and scope of the tariffs they author-
ize. See supra, at 8–9; post, at 62–63. We do not speculate on hypothet-
ical cases not before us.
Congress’s pattern of usage is most relevant to answering
that question. That pattern is plain: When Congress grants
the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with care-
ful constraints. It did neither here.
The Government raises another contextual argument.
Because “regulate” “lies between” two “poles” in IEEPA—
“compel” on the affirmative end and “prohibit” on the nega-
tive end—the term naturally includes the “less extreme,
more flexible” tool of tariffs. Reply Brief 9 (internal quota-
tion marks omitted); see post, at 29–30 (opinion of
KAVANAUGH, J.) (making a greater-includes-the-lesser ar-
gument). But tariffs, as discussed above, are different in
kind, not degree, from the other authorities in IEEPA. Un-
like those authorities, tariffs operate directly on domestic
importers to raise revenue for the Treasury. See 19 U. S. C.
§1505(a); 19 CFR §141.1(b) (2025). Even though a tariff is,
in some sense, “less extreme” than an outright compulsion
or prohibition, it does not follow that tariffs lie on the spec-
trum between those poles. They are instead “very clear[ly]
. . . a branch of the taxing power,” Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at
201, and fall outside the spectrum entirely.
Finding no support in the statute the President invoked,
the Government turns to one he did not: IEEPA’s predeces-
sor, TWEA. Ch. 106, 40 Stat. 411. In 1975, the Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals held that the authority to
“regulate . . . importation” in TWEA authorized President
Nixon to impose limited tariffs. United States v. Yoshida
Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560, 572, 577–578. When Congress en-
acted IEEPA two years later, the Government contends, it
conveyed that same authority (except without the limits).
See also post, at 14–17 (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.).
This argument cannot bear the weight the Government
places on it. While this Court sometimes assumes that Con-
gress incorporates judicial definitions into legislation, we do
so “only when [the] term’s meaning was ‘well-settled’” be-
fore the adoption. Kemp v. United States, 596 U. S. 528,
539 (2022) (quoting Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 22
(1999)); see also United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U. S.
402, 412–415 (2015). A single, expressly limited opinion
from a specialized intermediate appellate court does not
clear that hurdle.5 See BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council
of Baltimore, 593 U. S. 230, 244 (2021). The tariff authority
asserted by President Nixon, moreover, was “far removed”
from TWEA’s “original purposes” of sanctioning foreign bel-
ligerents. Cohen, Fundamentals of U. S. Foreign Trade Pol-
icy, at 178–179. We are therefore skeptical that Congress
enacted IEEPA with an eye toward granting that novel
power.
The Government has another historical argument based
on this Court’s wartime precedents. See generally Brief for
Professor Aditya Bamzai as Amicus Curiae; Reply Brief 9–
11, 18. According to the Government, those precedents
acknowledge an inherent Presidential power to impose tar-
iffs during armed conflict. And, the argument goes, Con-
gress in TWEA, and then in IEEPA, codified those prece-
dents. But this argument fails at both steps. Insofar as the
Government relies on our wartime cases themselves, they
are facially inapposite. Regardless of what they might
mean for the President’s inherent wartime authority, all
——————
5The Government, citing the IEEPA House Committee Report, con-
tends that Congress “indisputably knew of ” Yoshida’s interpretation of
TWEA. Brief for Federal Parties 26; see also post, at 15–16, and n. 11
(opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.). But even taking the Report at face value, it
hardly helps the Government. The Report explains that “[s]uccessive
Presidents have seized upon the open-endedness of [TWEA] section 5(b)
to turn that section, through usage, into something quite different from
what was envisioned in 1917.” H. R. Rep. No. 95–459, pp. 8–9 (1977);
accord, S. Cohen, R. Blecker, & P. Whitney, Fundamentals of U. S. For-
eign Trade Policy 178–179 (2d ed. 2003). That is not exactly a stamp of
approval on the action Yoshida guardedly endorsed. And in any event,
the Government’s “knew of ” standard falls well short of the “broad and
unquestioned” “judicial consensus” we have required to conclude that
Congress incorporated a judicial definition into a statutory term. Jama
v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 349 (2005).
agree that the President has no inherent peacetime author-
ity to impose tariffs.
Nor are we persuaded that the dots connect from our war-
time precedents, through multiple iterations of TWEA, to
IEEPA, such that IEEPA should be interpreted to grant the
President an expansive peacetime tariff power. This argu-
ment relies extensively on a series of inferences drawn from
scant legislative history. Such an attenuated chain cannot
support—much less “clearly” support—a reading of IEEPA
that includes the distinct power to impose tariffs. Alabama
Assn., 594 U. S., at 764.
Turning to this Court’s precedents, the Government first
relies on Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG,
Inc., 426 U. S. 548 (1976). There, we held that Section
232(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the
President to “adjust the imports” of particular goods to pro-
tect national security, includes the power to impose “license
fees.” Id., at 561. But that holding bears little on the mean-
ing of IEEPA. As a textual matter, Section 232(b) author-
izes the President not only to “adjust . . . imports,” but (as
the Government emphasized in Algonquin) to “take such ac-
tion . . . as he deems necessary” to adjust the imports of a
good. Brief for Petitioners 26 (emphasis in original) and Tr.
of Oral Arg. 6–7, in Federal Energy Administration v. Al-
gonquin SNG, Inc., O. T. 1975, No. 75–382. IEEPA does not
contain such sweeping, discretion-conferring language. As
for context, Section 232(a) states that “[n]o action shall be
taken” to “decrease or eliminate” an existing “duty or other
import restriction” if doing so would threaten national se-
curity. 19 U. S. C. §1862(a) (1970 ed.). This explicit refer-
ence to duties preceding Section 232(b) renders it natural
for Section 232(b) itself to authorize duties. Thus, we de-
cline to extend Algonquin’s expressly “limited” holding any
further. 426 U. S., at 571.
Finally, the Government invokes Dames & Moore v. Re-
gan, 453 U. S. 654 (1981), but that case offers no support.
Dames & Moore was exceedingly narrow,6 did not address
the President’s power to “regulate,” and did not involve tar-
iffs at all. If anything, that case highlights the importance
of close attention to IEEPA’s text. “The terms of . . .
IEEPA,” we held, “do not authorize” the suspension of
claims. Id., at 675. So too here; the terms of IEEPA do not
authorize tariffs.
