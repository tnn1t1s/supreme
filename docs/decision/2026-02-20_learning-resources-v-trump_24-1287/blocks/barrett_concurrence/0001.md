25–250 v.
V.O.S. SELECTIONS, INC., ET AL.
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT
[February 20, 2026]
JUSTICE BARRETT, concurring.
As the principal opinion demonstrates, the most natural
reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act does not encompass the power to impose tariffs. I write
only to address JUSTICE GORSUCH’s concurrence regarding
the major questions doctrine.
To the extent that JUSTICE GORSUCH attacks the view
that “common sense” alone can explain all our major ques-
tions decisions, ante, at 18–22, he takes down a straw man.
I have never espoused that view. Rather, as I explained in
my concurrence in Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U. S. 477, 507
(2023), the major questions doctrine “situates text in con-
text” and is therefore best understood as an ordinary appli-
cation of textualism. Id., at 511. Textualists—like all those
who use language to communicate—do not interpret words
in a vacuum. Instead, we use context, including “[b]ack-
ground legal conventions,” “common sense,” and “constitu-
tional structure,” to ascertain a text’s “most natural mean-
ing.” Id., at 511–512, 515, 509.
Part of this context, as I have explained, is Article I of the
Constitution, which vests Congress with “‘[a]ll legislative
Powers.’” Id., at 515 (quoting Art. I, §1). Obviously, the
Constitution bears on the meaning of a statute enacted pur-
suant to it. Because Article I grants all legislative powers
to Congress, the reasonable interpreter would expect Con-
gress “to make the big-time policy calls itself, rather than
pawning them off to another branch.” Nebraska, 600 U. S.,
at 515 ().1
To the extent that JUSTICE GORSUCH also thinks that
background legal conventions and constitutional structure
inform the most natural reading of a statute, then we may
not be very far apart. See ante, at 8–12, 14 (concurring
opinion). Our only disagreement may be over the level of
clarity required before a particular interpretation can be
deemed the most natural one. I understand JUSTICE
GORSUCH to require Congress always to speak precisely to
any major power that it intends to give away. See ante, at
12–14, 25–26 (concurring opinion). As I have said before, I
think that other, “less obvious” clues can do the trick. See
Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 514 (). I do
not see any such clues here; in fact, as the Court explains,
the clues we have point in the opposite direction. See, e.g.,
ante, at 8–9 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.) (detailing how

1 Contrary to JUSTICE GORSUCH’s suggestion, this approach to the ma-
jor questions doctrine does not risk “conflating unenacted legislative in-
tent with the law.” Ante, at 24, n.2 (concurring opinion). Rather, like
textualism more generally, it looks for “a sort of ‘objectified’ intent—the
intent that a reasonable person would gather from the text of the law,
placed alongside the remainder of the corpus juris,” including the Con-
stitution. A. Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 17 (1997).
Congress has elsewhere delegated the power to impose tar-
iffs); ante, at 14–15 (majority opinion) (stressing that the
Government “cannot identify any statute in which the
power to regulate includes the power to tax”).
At times, though, JUSTICE GORSUCH suggests that the
purpose of the major questions doctrine is something other
than to ascertain the most natural reading of a statute. For
example, he writes that the doctrine serves to prevent
“highly resourceful members of the executive branch” from
“assum[ing] new power for themselves” because “men are
not angels.” Ante, at 16 (concurring opinion); see West Vir-
ginia v. EPA, 597 U. S. 697, 735 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., con-
curring) (describing doctrine as a “clear-statement rul[e]”
that “operates to protect foundational constitutional guar-
antees”); National Federation of Independent Business v.
OSHA, 595 U. S. 109, 124–126 (2022) (GORSUCH, J., con-
curring) (similar). But if the Constitution permits Congress
to give the Executive a particular power, who are we to get
in the way? Does the Judiciary really protect the Constitu-
tion by impeding the constitutional action of another
branch? If JUSTICE GORSUCH thinks that we should forgo
the most natural reading of a statute because it is prefera-
ble for Congress, rather than the President, to make big de-
cisions, that way lies “a lot of trouble” for the textualist. A.
Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation 28 (1997) (Scalia).
Strong-form substantive canons—canons instructing a
judge to adopt “an inferior-but-tenable reading”—veer be-
yond interpretation and into policymaking. Nebraska, 600
U. S., at 509 (). And while the pol-
icy may be desirable or even constitutionally inspired,
judges should hesitate to impose disciplining rules on Con-
gress. See ibid., n. 2 (explaining that such “prophylactic
constraints” are “in tension with the Constitution’s struc-
ture”). As Justice Scalia lamented, “whether these dice-
loading rules are bad or good, there is also the question of
where the courts get the authority to impose them. Can we
really just decree that we will interpret the laws that Con-
gress passes to mean less or more than what they fairly
say?” Scalia 28–29.
Granted, strong-form canons exist elsewhere in the law.
See Nebraska, 600 U. S., at 508–509 (BARRETT, J., concur-
ring). I do not propose to abandon these canons, nor have I
taken the position that adopting them necessarily exceeds
the judicial power. Id., at 509, n. 2. But I am skeptical
about adding new ones to the mix. Ibid. And while the
major questions doctrine has an impressive pedigree as an
interpretive principle, this Court has not (yet, anyway) em-
braced it as a strong-form rule that imposes a “‘clarity tax’”
on Congress. Id., at 508.
JUSTICE GORSUCH seems to disagree, pointing to a few
late 19th- and early 20th-century cases.2 See ante, at 12–
14 (concurring opinion). But these cases, like our modern
ones, are consistent with my context-based approach: They
focus on ascertaining, not shaping, what the statute in dis-
pute communicates. See, e.g., ICC v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T.
P. R. Co., 167 U. S. 479, 511 (1897) (concluding that Con-
gress “did not intend” to give interstate commission power
to set railroad rates); Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co.,
213 U. S. 175, 196 (1909) (reasoning that “the legislature
never intended to and did not in fact” give a state commis-
sion power to set maximum railroad rates). I would not
treat this evidence as precedent for a judicial flex. JUSTICE
GORSUCH proposes to do something new. The innovation is
in significant tension with textualism, so I do not support
the project.

2He also points to state cases and longstanding corporate law princi-
ples. Ante, at 8–13 (concurring opinion). While those sources support
the existence of a background legal convention that informs a statute’s
most natural meaning, they are not evidence that this Court—which is
bound by the constraints of Article III—has adopted a true clear-state-
ment rule.
