**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Senior Staff
**FROM:** Office of Institutional Analysis
**DATE:** 2026-02-20
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* from a Perspective on Executive Power

This memorandum provides a structured analysis of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, focusing on its implications for executive power, particularly from an institutional perspective concerned with potential executive overreach. The analysis is grounded exclusively in the legal reasoning articulated within the opinions, without addressing policy merits or inferring motives.

***

### 1. Overview of the Decision

The Supreme Court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(B), does **not** authorize the President to impose tariffs. This judgment affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

*   **Binding Holding:** A six-justice majority concluded that the power to "regulate . . . importation" in IEEPA, under ordinary principles of **statutory interpretation**, does not encompass the distinct power to impose tariffs, which is a form of **taxation** (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22). The reasoning highlighted that Congress consistently delegates the **taxing power** explicitly and with constraints, and that an expansive reading of "regulate" could raise **constitutional avoidance** concerns regarding taxing exports.

*   **Plurality Reasoning on Major Questions Doctrine (Non-Binding):** A three-justice plurality (Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch and Barrett) also reasoned that the President's assertion of tariff authority implicated the **major questions doctrine**, requiring "clear congressional authorization" due to the action's "vast economic and political significance" and "transformative expansion" of executive authority, which IEEPA lacked (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20). However, this reasoning did not command a majority of the Court, as Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson explicitly found it "unnecessary" to their conclusion (REASONING, 24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-79).

*   **Dissenting Position:** Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito dissented, arguing that the ordinary meaning, history, and precedent demonstrate that "regulate . . . importation" *does* include tariffs as a traditional regulatory tool (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109).

### 2. Analysis from a Perspective Concerned with Unilateral Executive Power

**(a) Parts of the Decision that Genuinely Constrain Unilateral Executive Power Going Forward:**

The core of the decision, the six-justice majority's **statutory interpretation**, genuinely constrains unilateral executive power.

*   **Clarity on Taxing Power:** The binding holding establishes that broad grants of regulatory authority do not implicitly include the distinct **taxing power**. This means that without explicit and clear authorization from Congress, the President cannot unilaterally impose financial exactions like tariffs under general "regulate" language (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22). This directly limits the President's ability to act on major economic policy without a specific legislative directive.
*   **Reinforcement of Congressional Prerogative:** The emphasis on Congress's consistent practice of explicitly delegating tariff authority, and the constitutional avoidance concern regarding export taxes, reinforces **Article I**'s vesting of the **taxing power** in Congress. This serves as a check on executive attempts to bypass the legislative process for revenue-raising measures.

**(b) Parts of the Decision that Leave Open Paths for an Administration to Exercise Equal or Greater Power with Congressional Cooperation:**

The decision does not eliminate the ability of the executive branch to exercise significant power, including over tariffs, but rather clarifies the required source of that authority: clear congressional authorization.

*   **Clear Legislative Roadmap:** The decision effectively provides a roadmap for Congress. By articulating precisely *why* IEEPA's language was insufficient (lack of explicit mention of "duties" or "tariffs," absence of specific constraints), the Court indicates that a future Congress could grant such authority explicitly. If Congress passes a statute that unequivocally authorizes the President to impose tariffs under specific conditions, that delegation would likely withstand judicial review.
*   **Existing Statutory Authorities:** The dissent itself points to numerous other federal statutes that already authorize the President to impose tariffs under various circumstances (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113). The decision clarifies that the President "checked the wrong statutory box" for these specific tariffs, rather than lacking the power entirely, suggesting that an administration could achieve similar ends by adhering to different statutory frameworks that feature more specific congressional delegations.

**(c) Where, if Anywhere, Does the Court’s Reasoning Risk Entrenching Executive Authority Rather Than Diminishing It?**

While the decision primarily serves as a check on executive power, certain aspects of the reasoning, particularly in dissenting opinions, could be interpreted as potentially opening avenues for broader executive authority in specific contexts if they were to gain future precedential weight.

*   **Justice Thomas's Nondelegation Argument:** Justice Thomas's dissent argues that the power to impose duties on imports is *not* within "the core legislative power" because it pertains to "external affairs" (REASONING, 24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98). He contends that Congress can therefore delegate the exercise of this power to the President more freely, without the stringent limitations typically applied to delegations of core legislative power.
    *   **Risk:** If this reasoning were adopted, it could significantly expand executive authority in the **foreign affairs power** domain, potentially classifying a wider array of powers as not "core legislative" and thus subject to less stringent **nondelegation doctrine** review, even without the kind of explicit statutory authorization demanded by the majority for the taxing power. This would effectively entrench executive discretion in foreign affairs by diminishing the required level of congressional specificity.

*   **Justice Kavanaugh's Argument for Foreign Affairs Exception to Major Questions Doctrine:** The principal dissent argued, in the alternative, that the **major questions doctrine** "does not apply in the foreign affairs context" (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113).
    *   **Risk:** Were this position to become controlling, it could reduce judicial oversight of executive actions taken under broad statutory grants in foreign policy or national security. By carving out a categorical exception for foreign affairs, courts might be precluded from demanding clear congressional authorization for significant executive actions in this area, potentially allowing for greater unilateral executive authority.

### 3. Conclusion: Structural Implications for Separation of Powers

The *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* decision reaffirms the **separation of powers** by clarifying the allocation of specific powers between the legislative and executive branches. The core **HOLDING** underscores Congress's primary **Article I** role in exercising the **taxing power**, even when such powers have regulatory effects. While the executive branch retains broad authority to respond to national emergencies under statutes like IEEPA, that authority is delimited by the specific language of congressional delegation. The role of the judiciary, under **Article III**, is to ensure that executive actions remain within these legislatively prescribed bounds.
