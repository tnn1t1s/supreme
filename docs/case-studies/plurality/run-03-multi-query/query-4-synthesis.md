**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Interested Parties
**FROM:** Office of Institutional Analysis
**DATE:** 2026-02-20
**SUBJECT:** Contextualizing *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* (24-1287, 25-250)

This brief provides a structured and non-partisan overview of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, offering legal context to public commentary regarding the ruling and the duration of the tariffs in question.

***

### 1. The Supreme Court's Decision: *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*

The Supreme Court today held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(B), does **not** authorize the President to impose tariffs. The Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

*   **The Binding Holding (6 Justices):** The narrowest controlling principle, commanding a majority of six justices (Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson), is a principle of **statutory interpretation** concerning the **taxing power**.
    *   The Court held that the authority to "regulate . . . importation" in IEEPA does not encompass the distinct power to impose tariffs (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22).
    *   This conclusion was based on several points of **REASONING**:
        *   The ordinary meaning of "regulate" does not typically include taxation.
        *   Congress consistently delegates its power to impose tariffs or duties through explicit terms and with clear constraints, which were absent from IEEPA.
        *   Interpreting "regulate" to include the power to tax would render part of IEEPA unconstitutional, as the Constitution forbids taxing exports.
        *   The "neighboring words" in the statute do not suggest a revenue-raising power.

*   **Non-Binding Plurality Reasoning on the Major Questions Doctrine:** While Chief Justice Roberts's opinion discussed the **major questions doctrine**, finding that the President's assertion of tariff authority involved a "major question" requiring "clear congressional authorization" (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20), this analysis commanded only three votes (Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch and Barrett).
    *   Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson explicitly declined to join this part of the opinion, stating that the major questions doctrine was "unnecessary" to their conclusion, as ordinary principles of statutory interpretation were sufficient (REASONING, 24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-79). This crucial point is also evident from the join footnote in the Chief Justice's opinion (24-1287_roberts_majority_0001, p. 7).
    *   Therefore, the **major questions doctrine reasoning is not a binding holding** of the Court in this case. Per *Marks v. United States*, the controlling precedent is the narrower ground of statutory interpretation on which a majority agreed.

### 2. The Duration of the Tariffs and the Constitutional System

The concern about tariffs being "in effect for almost a year" raises important questions about the functioning of the constitutional system.

*   **The Judicial Process and Stays:** The Supreme Court's stay of a lower court decision in August 2025 allowed the tariffs to remain in effect pending full review. A stay is a temporary legal order that prevents a lower court's ruling from taking effect while an appeal is ongoing. This mechanism is a routine part of the appellate process, designed to preserve the status quo and allow for thorough judicial consideration of complex legal questions before a final judgment is rendered.
*   **The Role of Judicial Review:** The Court's decision today, while delayed, demonstrates the constitutional system's intended function of checks and balances. The judiciary's role, as defined by **Article III**, is to interpret the law and determine whether executive actions are authorized by Congress. The Court ultimately concluded that the President's actions exceeded the authority granted by Congress.
*   **Delays as a Feature, Not a Flaw:** The time taken for judicial review, including the period a stay is in effect, is inherent to a system that prioritizes careful deliberation and due process. While significant economic impacts can occur during this period, the judicial branch acts as a constitutional check, ensuring that legislative enactments and executive actions conform to the rule of law. The eventual invalidation of the tariffs, after a period of review, signifies the constitutional system working to correct an executive action deemed unlawful, rather than reflecting its failure.

### 3. The Court's Function and Calls for Reform

Commentary asserting that the outcome signals a "corrupt" Court or a need for "thoroughly reforming" it warrants a distinction between policy disagreement and the Court's constitutional function.

*   **Judicial Independence:** The Court's decision represents its exercise of judicial independence to interpret statutes and the Constitution, separate from political pressures or policy preferences. The role of the Court is to declare "what the law is," not to legislate or to implement preferred policy outcomes.
*   **Separation of Powers:** The holding in *Learning Resources* reinforces the principle of **separation of powers** by clarifying that the **taxing power**, a core function of **Article I** Congress, is not implicitly delegated through general regulatory language. This upholds the legislative prerogative.
*   **Legitimate Disagreement vs. Corruption:** Disagreement with the Court's legal interpretations is a legitimate and often robust part of public discourse in a democratic society. However, attributing outcomes to "corruption" without specific factual grounding beyond disagreement with the legal result mischaracterizes the judicial process. The decision in *Learning Resources* reflects a legal conclusion based on statutory text, congressional practice, and constitutional principles, as interpreted by a majority of the Court.

In conclusion, the *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* decision, while addressing significant economic issues, is fundamentally a case about **statutory interpretation** and the precise scope of delegated congressional power. The judicial process, including the issuance of stays, is a designed element of the constitutional system for orderly and deliberate resolution of legal disputes. The Court's role is to ensure that executive actions are consistent with the laws passed by Congress, thereby upholding the foundational principle of the **separation of powers**.
