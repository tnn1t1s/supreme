In a future case where Congress amends IEEPA to explicitly authorize the President to "regulate importation, including through duties or tariffs, during a declared national emergency," the following shifts in votes and doctrinal objections are likely:

### I. Predicted Vote Changes

It is highly probable that all nine justices would vote to **uphold** the President's actions under the amended statute. This would represent a unanimous 9-0 decision, as the amendment directly addresses the core statutory interpretation issue that divided the Court in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*.

1.  **Justices Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett (Plurality on Major Questions, Majority on Statutory Interpretation):**
    *   **Original Position:** These three justices, forming the plurality on the Major Questions Doctrine, concluded that IEEPA lacked "clear congressional authorization" for tariffs (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20). They also joined the majority's statutory interpretation finding that "regulate . . . importation" did not include tariffs (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-26).
    *   **Impact of Amendment:** The proposed amendment provides the explicit language ("including through duties or tariffs") that they found missing. This would provide the "clear congressional authorization" required by their major questions analysis and satisfy their ordinary statutory interpretation concerns.
    *   **Vote Change:** They would **change their vote** from striking down the tariffs to upholding them.

2.  **Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson (Concurrence in Part, Solely on Statutory Interpretation):**
    *   **Original Position:** These three justices concurred in the judgment, agreeing that ordinary principles of statutory interpretation showed IEEPA did not authorize tariffs. They explicitly stated that the major questions doctrine was "unnecessary" for their conclusion (REASONING, 24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 79-80).
    *   **Impact of Amendment:** The amendment directly provides the textual clarity regarding tariffs that was lacking under ordinary statutory interpretation.
    *   **Vote Change:** They would **change their vote** from striking down the tariffs to upholding them, based on their preferred method of statutory interpretation.

3.  **Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito (Dissenters):**
    *   **Original Position:** These three justices dissented, arguing that IEEPA's existing language ("regulate . . . importation") already authorized tariffs as a matter of ordinary meaning, history, and precedent (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109).
    *   **Impact of Amendment:** The explicit amendment further reinforces their original view of congressional intent, providing even stronger textual support for the President's authority.
    *   **Vote Change:** They would **not change their vote** in terms of the outcome (they already would have upheld the tariffs), but the new statutory language would solidify their reasoning.

### II. Remaining Doctrinal Objections

While the amended statute would likely secure a unanimous judgment, some justices might retain or highlight certain doctrinal objections or theoretical positions, though these would likely not lead to a vote against the amended statute itself, but rather to different rationales for upholding it or to continued jurisprudential debates.

1.  **Justice Barrett's Resistance to the Major Questions Doctrine's Foundation (Fracture F3):**
    *   **Original Position:** Justice Barrett resisted Justice Gorsuch's view of the major questions doctrine as a "substantive canon" external to a statute, arguing instead that it is "best understood as an ordinary application of textualism" that "situates text in context" (REASONING/DICTA, 24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001, p. 74).
    *   **Remaining Objection:** While she would vote to uphold, she might continue to articulate her view that the explicit statutory language directly clarifies congressional intent in a way that aligns with her textualist interpretation of the major questions doctrine, rather than viewing it as Congress being "disciplined" by a court-imposed clear-statement rule. This is a theoretical disagreement about the doctrine's nature, not an objection to the amended law.

2.  **Justice Thomas's Nondelegation View on "Core Legislative Power" (Fracture F5):**
    *   **Original Position:** Justice Thomas argued that the power to impose duties on imports is *not* a "core legislative power" (REASONING, 24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98) because it pertains to external affairs, and therefore Congress can freely delegate this power to the President without violating the nondelegation doctrine.
    *   **Remaining Objection:** This fundamental theoretical position would still be available to Justice Thomas. He could reiterate that even with the explicit language, this power is appropriately delegable and does not pose the same nondelegation concerns as other legislative powers. This would be a continued jurisprudential point about the constitutional limits of delegation, rather than an objection to the validity of the amended statute, which now clearly delegates the power.

3.  **Justice Kavanaugh's Foreign Affairs Exception to the Major Questions Doctrine (Fracture F4):**
    *   **Original Position:** Justice Kavanaugh argued that the major questions doctrine generally "does not apply in the foreign affairs context" (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113), reasoning that Congress often intends to grant broad authority to the Executive in this realm (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0011, pp. 152-156).
    *   **Remaining Objection:** While the explicit amendment would satisfy any clear statement requirement the major questions doctrine might impose, Justice Kavanaugh could still maintain his position that the doctrine's application in foreign affairs contexts is generally inappropriate. He might write separately to emphasize that the explicit amendment *over-satisfies* a requirement he believes shouldn't strictly apply in the first place, or to reinforce his broader point about executive flexibility in foreign policy. This would be a resistance to the doctrine's scope, not an objection to the amended statute.

In conclusion, the proposed amendment would likely lead to a unanimous Court upholding the President's power to impose tariffs under IEEPA, as it directly resolves the statutory ambiguity at the heart of the original decision. The remaining "objections" would largely be theoretical points about the nature of judicial review and constitutional interpretation, rather than challenges to the legality of the new statutory language.
