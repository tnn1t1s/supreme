**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Interested Parties

**DATE:** 2026-02-20
**SUBJECT:** Institutional Analysis of the Supreme Court's Decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* (24-1287, 25-250)

This memorandum provides a structured, non-partisan breakdown of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, addressing points raised in public commentary concerning executive authority, economic policy, and constitutional function.

### 1. The Supreme Court's Holding on IEEPA and Tariffs

The Supreme Court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The Court's judgment affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

*   **Binding Holding (6 Justices):** A majority of six justices (Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson) agreed on the narrowest legal principle explaining the judgment: under ordinary principles of **statutory interpretation**, the power to "regulate . . . importation" in IEEPA does not encompass the distinct power to impose tariffs (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22).
    *   The Court's **REASONING** emphasized that the term "regulate," in its ordinary usage, is not generally understood to include "taxation." It noted that when Congress intends to delegate its **taxing power**, including the power to impose duties or tariffs, it consistently does so with explicit language and specific constraints, which were found to be absent in IEEPA (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 20).
    *   Additionally, the Court observed that interpreting IEEPA to include the power to tax would present a potential **constitutional avoidance** issue, as the statute authorizes regulation of "importation or exportation," and the Constitution expressly forbids taxing exports (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 22).

*   **Dissenting Position (3 Justices):** Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito dissented. Their **REASONING** was that the "statutory text, history, and precedent demonstrate that the answer is clearly yes" to whether tariffs are a means to "regulate . . . importation" (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109). The dissent contended that the ordinary meaning and historical usage of the phrase include tariffs as a traditional tool of regulating importation.

### 2. Legal Interpretation vs. Policy Preferences

The critique suggests the Court substituted its "economic policy preferences for the elected President’s judgment." The Court's decision, however, is presented as an exercise of **judicial review** grounded in **statutory interpretation**, not policymaking.

*   **Judicial Review:** The Court's function under **Article III** of the Constitution is to interpret the laws enacted by Congress. In this case, the question presented was strictly one of legal authority: whether the President's actions fell within the scope of power delegated by IEEPA. The Court expressly disclaimed policy judgments: "We claim no special competence in matters of economics or foreign affairs. We claim only, as we must, the limited role assigned to us by Article III of the Constitution" (REASONING/DICTA, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0007, p. 27).
*   **Distinction Between Regulation and Taxation:** While tariffs can serve regulatory purposes, the majority distinguished the power to "regulate" from the power to "tax." The Court observed that "the ‘power to regulate commerce’ is ‘entirely distinct from the right to levy taxes’” (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 21). This clarifies that even if tariffs are a form of regulation, the Court reasoned they are also a form of taxation, a power requiring specific congressional authorization.

### 3. Delimiting Executive Authority and Congressional Delegation

The critique asserts that IEEPA "clearly allows regulation of imports" and that tariffs are a "traditional regulatory tool," implying the Court unduly narrowed executive authority. The opinions in the case reveal several distinct legal approaches to this question.

*   **Congressional Delegation and Clear Authorization:** A three-justice plurality (Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch and Barrett) applied the **major questions doctrine**, a canon of **statutory interpretation** that requires "clear congressional authorization" for executive actions of "vast economic and political significance" that represent a "transformative expansion" of executive authority (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, p. 13). This plurality reasoned that the asserted power to unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs met this threshold and lacked the requisite clarity in IEEPA (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20).
*   **Reasonable Legal Disagreement on the Major Questions Doctrine:** It is important to note that the major questions doctrine reasoning only commanded three votes and is not a binding holding. Three other justices in the majority (Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson) explicitly found this doctrine "unnecessary," concluding that ordinary **statutory interpretation** was sufficient to decide the case (REASONING, 24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-79).
*   **Dissenting View on Foreign Affairs:** The principal dissent also disagreed with the application of the major questions doctrine, arguing that it "does not apply in the foreign affairs context" where Congress routinely grants broader executive discretion (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113). This highlights a point of **reasonable legal disagreement** regarding the doctrine's scope.
*   **Emergency Powers:** The Court's majority acknowledged IEEPA as an **emergency powers** statute but rejected the argument that such statutes should be interpreted broadly enough to confer major powers, like taxation, for which there is no explicit textual basis. It also noted the "lack of historical precedent" for invoking IEEPA to impose tariffs of this magnitude (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 18-19).

### 4. Conclusion: Separation of Powers

The *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* decision underscores the constitutional principle of **separation of powers**.

*   **Legislative Authority (Article I):** Congress holds the primary authority over the **taxing power** and **foreign commerce**, as outlined in **Article I** of the Constitution. The power to impose tariffs is "very clear[ly] . . . a branch of the taxing power" (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0004, p. 12).
*   **Executive Authority (Article II):** The President exercises executive power, but this power is often dependent on and limited by **congressional delegation**, especially in matters involving revenue and domestic economic regulation.
*   **Judicial Role (Article III):** The Court's role is not to set economic policy or to determine the effectiveness of executive actions in addressing foreign threats. Instead, the judiciary provides a check by interpreting the scope of legislative grants of authority to the executive branch. The Court's decision affirmed that in this instance, Congress had not delegated the authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA.
