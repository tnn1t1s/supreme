**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Senior Staff
**FROM:** Office of Institutional Analysis
**DATE:** 2026-02-20
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* from an Institutional Perspective on Unilateral Executive Power

This memorandum provides a structured analysis of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, focusing on its implications for executive power from an institutional perspective concerned with potential executive overreach. The analysis is grounded exclusively in the legal reasoning articulated within the opinions.

***

### 1. Overview of the Decision

The Supreme Court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The judgment affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

*   **Binding Holding:** A six-justice majority concluded that the power to "regulate . . . importation" in IEEPA, under ordinary principles of **statutory interpretation**, does not encompass the distinct power to impose tariffs, which is a form of **taxation** (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22). The reasoning highlighted that Congress consistently delegates the **taxing power** explicitly and with constraints.

*   **Plurality Reasoning (Non-Binding):** A three-justice plurality (Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch and Barrett) also reasoned that the President's assertion of tariff authority implicated the **major questions doctrine**, which requires "clear congressional authorization" for actions of "vast economic and political significance" (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20). This rationale did not command a majority, as three justices in the majority found it "unnecessary" (REASONING, 24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-79).

*   **Dissenting Position:** Three justices (Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito) dissented, arguing that "regulate . . . importation" does include tariffs as a traditional regulatory tool (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109).

### 2. Analysis of the Decision's Impact on Executive Power

**(a) Parts of the Decision that Genuinely Constrain Unilateral Executive Power Going Forward**

The decision's strength as a constraint on unilateral executive action lies entirely in its binding six-justice majority **HOLDING** on **statutory interpretation**.

*   **Strict Construction of Taxing Power:** The core holding establishes that broad statutory grants of regulatory authority (e.g., to "regulate") do not implicitly include the separate and distinct **taxing power**. The Court reasoned that "the ‘power to regulate commerce’ is ‘entirely distinct from the right to levy taxes’" (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 21). This creates a durable rule of construction that prevents the executive from unilaterally imposing financial exactions like tariffs under general regulatory statutes, thereby constraining presidential power over major economic policy.

*   **Reinforcement of Congressional Prerogative:** By emphasizing Congress's consistent historical practice of delegating tariff authority only through express and carefully limited terms, the majority reinforces the principle that the power of the purse originates with and must be clearly delegated by the legislature (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 14-15). This serves as a direct judicial check on executive attempts to find novel authority for revenue-raising measures in old, general-purpose statutes.

**(b) Parts of the Decision that Leave Open Paths for an Administration to Exercise Equal or Greater Power with Congressional Cooperation**

The decision is a constraint on *unilateral* action based on *ambiguous* statutes; it is not a prohibition on the exercise of such power when properly authorized.

*   **Provides a Legislative Roadmap:** The majority opinion effectively provides a blueprint for a future Congress that wishes to delegate tariff authority. By specifying what was textually absent from IEEPA—an explicit mention of "duties" or "tariffs" and specific constraints on their use—the Court indicates that a future statute containing such clear language would likely be upheld (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 20). The decision channels executive power, requiring it to secure explicit legislative cooperation rather than eliminating the power itself.

*   **Highlights Alternative Statutory Authorities:** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent notes that the decision does not eliminate the President's ability to impose tariffs, but rather clarifies that the wrong statutory authority was invoked. His opinion points out that "numerous other federal statutes authorize the President to impose tariffs" under different circumstances (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113). This suggests that an administration could achieve similar policy ends by utilizing these other, more specific congressional delegations.

**(c) Where, if Anywhere, Does the Court’s Reasoning Risk Entrenching Executive Authority Rather Than Diminishing It?**

While the binding holding constrains executive power, non-binding reasoning in the dissents presents theories that, if adopted by a future majority, could significantly entrench executive authority.

*   **Justice Thomas's Nondelegation Argument:** In his dissent, Justice Thomas argues that the power to impose duties on imports is *not* "within the core legislative power" because it pertains to "external affairs" (REASONING, 24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98). He concludes that Congress can therefore delegate this power to the President with fewer restrictions than would be required for domestic matters.
    *   **Risk:** If this view were to become law, it would create a two-tiered **nondelegation doctrine**, allowing for vast and unspecific delegations of power to the President in any area touching on foreign affairs. This would substantially weaken judicial checks on executive authority in a broad and critical domain.

*   **Justice Kavanaugh's Foreign Affairs Exception to the Major Questions Doctrine:** The principal dissent argues in the alternative that the **major questions doctrine** "does not apply in the foreign affairs context" (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113).
    *   **Risk:** Adoption of this position would carve out a categorical exception from the primary judicial tool used to police major assertions of executive authority under ambiguous statutes. It would prevent courts from demanding a clear statement from Congress for even the most significant executive actions in foreign policy or national security, thereby risking greater unilateral executive power in those fields.
