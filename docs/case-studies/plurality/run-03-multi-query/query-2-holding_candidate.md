Based on the reasoning provided in the opinions in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, a congressional amendment explicitly authorizing the President to use "duties or tariffs" under IEEPA would likely result in a unanimous judgment upholding the President's action. However, the justices' underlying doctrinal disagreements would persist, likely surfacing in separate opinions.

### I. Analysis of Likely Vote Changes

A statutory amendment adding the phrase "including through duties or tariffs" would directly resolve the central legal question of the case, leading to a convergence on the outcome from all three of the Court's factions.

*   **The Six Justices from the Original Majority Would Change Their Votes to Uphold the Action.**
    *   **Reasoning for the Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett Plurality:** This group's vote was predicated on the absence of a "clear congressional authorization" for the tariffs, as required by the **major questions doctrine** (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, p. 13). The proposed amendment would provide exactly the kind of unambiguous, express delegation of the taxing power that their reasoning demanded. The statutory text would no longer be "ambiguous," and the delegation would be clear, satisfying their primary objection. Their votes would therefore change to uphold the President's authority.
    *   **Reasoning for the Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson Concurrence:** This group's vote was based on the conclusion that "ordinary principles of statutory interpretation" showed that the power to "regulate...importation" did not encompass tariffs (HOLDING, 24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 79). The amended text would directly incorporate the power to impose "duties or tariffs," resolving the issue on their preferred, narrower ground of statutory text and context. Their reason for invalidating the President's action would be eliminated, and their votes would change to uphold it.

*   **The Three Dissenting Justices Would Maintain Their Votes to Uphold the Action.**
    *   **Reasoning for the Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito Dissent:** This group argued that the *existing* statutory text ("regulate...importation") already authorized the President to impose tariffs (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 108). The explicit amendment would simply codify and reinforce their original interpretation of the statute's scope. Therefore, while their legal rationale would become even stronger, their ultimate vote to uphold the President's power would not change.

### II. Remaining Doctrinal Objections and Positions

Despite a likely unanimous judgment, the fundamental constitutional and methodological disagreements highlighted by the Court's fractures would remain. Justices would likely write separately to reiterate these positions, even while concurring in the judgment.

1.  **Justice Thomas's Nondelegation Doctrine Argument Would Remain.**
    *   **Objection:** Justice Thomas's dissent was grounded in a unique, originalist view of the **nondelegation doctrine**. He argued that the power to impose import duties is *not* a "core legislative power" because it pertains to external affairs and is thus freely delegable by Congress (REASONING, 24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98).
    *   **Availability:** This constitutional argument is independent of the statutory text's clarity. While Justice Thomas would agree that the amended statute clearly delegates the power, he would likely maintain that such a clear statement was never constitutionally required in the first place for this type of foreign affairs power. He could write separately to argue that the Court should uphold the delegation not because it meets a heightened standard of clarity, but because no such standard applies to the delegation of non-core powers.

2.  **Justice Kavanaugh's Foreign Affairs Exception to the Major Questions Doctrine Would Remain.**
    *   **Objection:** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent argued, in the alternative, that the **major questions doctrine** should not apply at all in cases involving foreign affairs and national security, where Congress is understood to legislate with a "broader brush" (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0011, p. 153).
    *   **Availability:** The amendment would satisfy the major questions doctrine's clear-statement demand, making the doctrine's application a moot point for the case's outcome. However, Justice Kavanaugh could still write separately to argue that while the standard is met here, the plurality was wrong to apply it in the first instance. He could maintain his position that courts should not use the doctrine as a "thumb on the scale against the President" in this domain.

3.  **The Gorsuch/Barrett Theoretical Split on the Major Questions Doctrine Would Remain.**
    *   **Objection:** The concurrences by Justice Gorsuch and Justice Barrett revealed a deep theoretical divide on the nature of the major questions doctrine itself (Fracture F3). Justice Gorsuch views it as a constitutionally-grounded "substantive canon" that enforces the separation of powers (DICTA, 24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0007, p. 44), while Justice Barrett views it as an "ordinary application of textualism" that uses constitutional context to find the "most natural meaning" of a statute (DICTA, 24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001, p. 74).
    *   **Availability:** This fundamental disagreement would be unaffected. In upholding the amended statute, Justice Gorsuch might emphasize that Congress has now met the constitutionally required burden of speaking clearly. Justice Barrett might argue that the clear text simply confirms the statute's "most natural meaning" without needing to invoke a "strong-form substantive canon."

In summary, a clear congressional amendment would resolve the immediate statutory dispute and unify the Court on the judgment. However, the underlying constitutional fissures—regarding nondelegation, the scope of the major questions doctrine, and its theoretical foundation—would remain fully available for debate in future cases.
