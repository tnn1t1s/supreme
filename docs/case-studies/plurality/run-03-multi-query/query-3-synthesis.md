### 1. Query & Scope

This report addresses the query: "How could a lower court plausibly misapply *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* while claiming fidelity to it, and which specific blocks in the decision would reveal that misapplication?"

The analysis is grounded in the decision corpus for *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, which comprises 53 text blocks across 8 opinions (syllabus, majority, 2 concurrences, 2 concurrences in part, 2 dissents). The primary misapplication identified involves elevating a three-justice plurality's reasoning to the status of a binding holding.

### 2. Vote Structure & Joins

The Court's 6-3 judgment is supported by a fractured majority, a critical detail for understanding potential misapplications. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, but crucial sections did not command a majority.

- **Majority in Judgment (6 Justices):** Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.
- **Dissenters (3 Justices):** Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.

The key to the fracture lies in the partial join structure, explicitly noted in the opinion:
- **Full Majority (6 Justices):** A majority of six justices joined Parts I, II–A–1, and II–B of the Chief Justice's opinion. These sections contain the background of the case and the holding based on statutory interpretation.
- **Plurality (3 Justices):** Only Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Gorsuch and Barrett joined Parts II-A-2 and III, which contain the reasoning based on the **major questions doctrine**. A footnote in the opening block of the opinion makes this clear: "*JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE JACKSON join only Parts I, II–A–1, and II–B of this opinion*" (24-1287_roberts_majority_0001, p. 7). This explicit textual instruction is the primary evidence against misapplying the plurality's reasoning as a holding.

### 3. Candidate Holdings

The decision presents two distinct rationales for the judgment, only one of which qualifies as a holding of the Court. A misapplication occurs by confusing the two.

**Candidate 1: Statutory Interpretation**
- **Proposition (HOLDING):** Under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the authority to "regulate . . . importation" in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the power to impose tariffs, because the power to tax is distinct from the power to regulate and Congress consistently delegates its tariff power explicitly (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22).
- **Majority Support:** 6 Justices.
- **Doctrinal Grounding:** Statutory Interpretation, Taxing Power.

**Candidate 2: Major Questions Doctrine**
- **Proposition (REASONING):** Because the President's assertion of tariff authority has "vast economic and political significance" and represents a "transformative expansion" of executive authority, the **major questions doctrine** requires a "clear congressional authorization" that IEEPA lacks (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20).
- **Majority Support:** 3 Justices.
- **Doctrinal Grounding:** Major Questions Doctrine, Clear Statement Rule, Separation of Powers.

A lower court would misapply this precedent by treating Candidate 2 as the binding holding while ignoring or downplaying Candidate 1.

### 4. Fracture Map

The Court's fractures reveal why the major questions doctrine reasoning is not a holding. The most relevant fracture is the disagreement over the necessity of that doctrine.

- **Fracture on Necessity of Major Questions Doctrine:**
  - **Side A (Plurality):** Three justices found it necessary to apply the major questions doctrine to invalidate the tariffs (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-14).
  - **Side B (Concurrence in Part):** Three justices in the majority explicitly rejected this step. Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote, "because I think the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result, I do not join the part of that opinion invoking the so-called major-questions doctrine." She added, "The use of a clear-statement rule here is unnecessary" (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-79).
- **Severity:** Significant. This fracture is the direct cause of the plurality opinion on the major questions doctrine and establishes that this reasoning was not essential to the judgment for half the majority.

### 5. Marks v. United States Analysis

*Marks* analysis applies because the majority was fractured on the legal rationale for the judgment.

- **Rationale for Applicability:** Because no single rationale commanded five votes (the plurality had three votes for a major questions rationale, and three justices concurred on narrower grounds), the holding is the narrowest ground that explains the judgment.
- **Narrowest Ground:** The concurrence by Justice Kagan, resting solely on **statutory interpretation**, provides the narrowest ground. This position is a logical subset of the plurality's reasoning—all six justices in the majority agreed that ordinary statutory interpretation compelled the result. Therefore, the binding holding of *Learning Resources* is the statutory interpretation principle articulated in Part II-B of the Chief Justice's opinion.
- **Assessment:** The major questions doctrine analysis in Part II-A-2 is the non-binding reasoning of a three-justice plurality. A lower court that applies this reasoning as the controlling precedent would be misapplying *Marks* and ignoring the actual holding of the case.
- **Ambiguity & Skepticism (per Invariant 7):** Although the *Marks* analysis here is relatively clear, the doctrine is often contested. The primary risk of misapplication stems from the fact that the non-binding reasoning appears in the "opinion of the Court," which could lead a lower court to mistakenly afford it binding weight.

### 6. Doctrinal Implications

- **Statutory Interpretation:** This decision advances a clear holding that the power to "regulate" an area of commerce does not presumptively include the distinct power to tax it; Congress must delegate its **taxing power** with greater clarity (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22). This holding commanded a majority.
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** The decision does *not* create any new binding precedent regarding the major questions doctrine. It leaves the doctrine's scope and theoretical underpinnings open, as reflected in the various concurrences and dissents. A lower court claiming the case is a "landmark major questions doctrine decision" would be incorrect.

### 7. Open Questions

The decision leaves significant ambiguity that a misapplying court would have to improperly resolve. By treating the plurality's reasoning as a holding, a lower court would ignore these open questions:

1.  **Is the major questions doctrine a necessary tool when ordinary interpretation suffices?** Justice Kagan's concurrence explicitly says no, a position shared by two other justices in the majority (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-79).
2.  **What is the correct way to identify a "major question"?** The decision provides no majority-backed test, only the plurality's application of factors like "vast economic and political significance" and "transformative expansion" of power (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, p. 13).

A lower court that correctly applies *Learning Resources* would recognize that the binding holding is a narrow one of statutory interpretation concerning the taxing power. A court that misapplies it would seize upon the plurality's broader language about the major questions doctrine, found in **24-1287_roberts_majority_0005**, while ignoring the dispositive textual evidence of the fracture in **24-1287_roberts_majority_0001** (footnote) and the explicit rejection of that reasoning's necessity in **24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001**.
