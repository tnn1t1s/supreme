### 1. Query & Scope

This report addresses the hypothetical query: "Assume a future case in which Congress amends IEEPA to authorize the President to 'regulate importation, including through duties or tariffs, during a declared national emergency.' Based solely on the reasoning expressed in the opinions in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, which justices’ votes are most likely to change, and which doctrinal objections—if any—would remain available to those who dissented or concurred in part?"

The analysis is grounded in the decision corpus for *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, which contains 53 blocks across 8 opinions (syllabus, majority, 2 concurrences, 2 concurrences in part, 2 dissents). The predictions herein are derived exclusively from the legal reasoning articulated by the justices in those opinions.

### 2. Vote Structure & Joins

In the original decision, the Court's judgment was supported by a 6-3 vote, but the majority's reasoning was fractured. Chief Justice Roberts authored the opinion of the Court, but not all parts commanded a majority.

- **Majority in Judgment (6 Justices):** Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.
- **Dissenters (3 Justices):** Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.

The join structure created two distinct rationales within the majority:
- **Full Majority on Statutory Grounds:** Six justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson) joined Parts I, II-A-1, and II-B, which resolved the case based on principles of **statutory interpretation** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0001, p. 7).
- **Plurality on Major Questions:** A three-justice plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) joined Parts II-A-2 and III, offering an alternative rationale based on the **major questions doctrine** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0001, p. 7).
- **Concurrence in Part:** Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson concurred in the judgment based only on statutory interpretation, finding the major questions analysis "unnecessary" (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 79).
- **Separate Opinions:** Justices Gorsuch (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0001), Barrett (24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001), Jackson (24-1287_jackson_concurrence_in_part_0001), Thomas (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0001), and Kavanaugh (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001) each wrote separately.

### 3. Candidate Holdings

The proposed statutory amendment directly addresses the central legal questions of the original case, satisfying the requirements of both factions within the original majority.

**Candidate 1: Statutory Interpretation of "Regulate"**
- **Original Proposition (HOLDING):** Under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the power to "regulate . . . importation" in IEEPA does not include the power to impose tariffs (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-26).
- **Original Majority Support:** 6 Justices.
- **Impact of Amendment:** The amendment's explicit phrase "including through duties or tariffs" would directly resolve the statutory ambiguity identified by all six justices in the original majority, satisfying their shared holding. This would cause the votes of Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson to change to uphold the President's action.

**Candidate 2: Major Questions Doctrine**
- **Original Proposition (REASONING):** The President's assertion of tariff authority under IEEPA is a "major question" that requires a "clear congressional authorization," which the statute lacks (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20).
- **Original Majority Support:** 3 Justices (Plurality).
- **Impact of Amendment:** The amendment would provide the exact "clear congressional authorization" that the plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) found missing. This would cause their votes to change to uphold the President's action, satisfying their primary doctrinal concern.

### 4. Fracture Map

While the hypothetical amendment would likely produce a unanimous judgment, it would not resolve the deep doctrinal fractures revealed in the original case. These fractures predict which objections would remain available.

- **Statutory Interpretation (Fracture F1):** This fracture, which was dispositive of the original case, would be resolved by the amended text. The dissenters (Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito), who argued the original text was sufficient (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109), would find their position codified. The six-justice majority, who found the text insufficient (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22), would find their objections addressed.

- **Major Questions Doctrine (Fractures F2, F3, F4):**
  - **Applicability to Foreign Affairs (F4):** The dissent led by Justice Kavanaugh argued that the major questions doctrine should not apply in the foreign affairs context at all (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0011, pp. 152-153). While the amended statute would satisfy the doctrine's demands, Justice Kavanaugh would retain the ability to argue in a separate opinion that the Court should never have applied the doctrine in the first place.
  - **Theoretical Foundation (F3):** The profound disagreement between Justice Gorsuch and Justice Barrett on the nature of the doctrine would persist. Justice Gorsuch could argue that Congress has now met the constitutionally required burden of a substantive canon (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0007, pp. 44-45), while Justice Barrett could maintain that the explicit text simply clarifies the statute's "most natural meaning" without resort to a "strong-form substantive canon" (24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001, p. 74).

- **Nondelegation Doctrine (Fracture F5):**
  - **Core Legislative Power:** Justice Thomas’s fundamental constitutional objection is independent of statutory clarity. He argued that the power to impose import duties is *not* a "core legislative power" because it pertains to external affairs and is thus freely delegable without violating the nondelegation doctrine (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98). This objection would remain fully available. He could argue that the amended statute is constitutional not because it meets a heightened clear-statement standard, but because no such standard was ever constitutionally required for this type of power.

### 5. Marks v. United States Analysis

In the original *Learning Resources* decision, *Marks* analysis is applicable because the six-justice majority was fractured as to its reasoning.

- **Narrowest Ground:** The narrowest ground for the decision is the holding based on **ordinary statutory interpretation**, as articulated in Part II-B of the Chief Justice's opinion and embraced by all six justices in the majority. The concurrence by Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, explicitly rested on this ground alone, calling the major questions doctrine "unnecessary" (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 79-80). This reasoning is a logical subset of the plurality's two-part rationale, making it the controlling principle.
- **Status of Major Questions Doctrine:** The plurality's analysis of the major questions doctrine in Part II-A-2 is non-binding reasoning, not a holding of the Court.
- **Ambiguity & Skepticism (per Invariant 7):** While the *Marks* analysis appears clear, its application is often contested. The location of the non-binding plurality reasoning within the "opinion of the Court" creates a risk that lower courts could mistakenly cite it as binding precedent. The profound theoretical disagreement between Justices Gorsuch and Barrett on the doctrine's nature further underscores that it is not a coherent, controlling rationale from this case.

### 6. Doctrinal Implications

Based on the hypothetical amendment and the justices' expressed reasoning:

- **Vote Changes:** The six justices of the original majority (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson) are most likely to **change their votes** to uphold the President's actions. The three dissenters (Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito) would maintain their votes to uphold the action, with their reasoning now being explicitly supported by the amended text.
- **Statutory Interpretation:** The specific statutory question at the heart of *Learning Resources* would be settled by the amendment.
- **Doctrinal Debates Left Open:** A unanimous judgment would not resolve the underlying constitutional debates. The amended statute would satisfy the plurality's demand for clarity under the **major questions doctrine**, but the core disagreements about the doctrine's scope (a foreign affairs exception) and its theoretical foundation would remain available for future litigation. Likewise, Justice Thomas's argument that the tariff power is not a "core legislative power" under the **nondelegation doctrine** is a constitutional claim that would be unaffected by the statutory amendment (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98).

### 7. Open Questions

Even with a unanimous judgment upholding the amended IEEPA, the core jurisprudential fissures from *Learning Resources* would persist, leaving key questions open:

1.  **Is the tariff power a "core legislative power" subject to strict nondelegation limits?** Justice Thomas's dissent argues it is not, a fundamental constitutional question independent of statutory text (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98).
2.  **Does the major questions doctrine apply in the context of foreign affairs?** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent argues for a categorical exception (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0011, pp. 152-153), a question mooted but not answered by the explicit statutory amendment.
3.  **What is the theoretical foundation of the major questions doctrine?** The Gorsuch-Barrett split between a constitutionally-grounded substantive canon and a textualist interpretive aid remains a key unresolved issue (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0007, pp. 44-45; 24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001, p. 74).
