### Institutional Analysis Report: *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*

**Docket:** 24-1287, 25-250
**Date of Decision:** 2026-02-20
**Analyst:** Synthesis Agent, Office of Institutional Analysis

### 1. Query & Scope

This report addresses the query: "What is the narrowest controlling principle that explains the judgment, and where do the concurrences and dissents explicitly reject or resist that principle?"

The analysis is grounded in a decision corpus for *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, comprising 53 text blocks from 8 opinions: the Syllabus, a majority opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, concurrences by Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, concurrences in part by Justices Kagan and Jackson, and dissents by Justices Thomas and Kavanaugh. Retrieval focused on blocks discussing concepts such as "holding," "controlling principle," "major questions doctrine," "statutory interpretation," "taxing power," "nondelegation," and "foreign affairs," as well as terms indicating rejection or resistance to a legal principle.

### 2. Vote Structure & Joins

The Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by a 6-3 vote. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, but its reasoning was fractured.

- **Majority in Judgment (6 Justices):** Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson.
- **Dissenters (3 Justices):** Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.

The internal structure of the majority is complex due to partial joins:
- **Full Majority (6 Justices):** A full majority of six justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson) joined Parts I, II-A-1, and II-B of the Chief Justice's opinion. These sections contain the background and the statutory interpretation analysis (24-1287_roberts_majority_0001, p. 7).
- **Plurality (3 Justices):** Only a three-justice plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) joined Parts II-A-2 and III, which ground the decision in the **major questions doctrine** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0001, p. 7).
- **Concurrence in Part (3 Justices):** Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson explicitly declined to join the major questions doctrine analysis, concurring in the judgment based only on the statutory interpretation reasoning (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 78).
- **Separate Opinions:** Justice Gorsuch and Justice Barrett wrote separate concurrences to elaborate on the major questions doctrine. Justice Jackson wrote separately to emphasize the utility of legislative history. Justice Thomas wrote a dissent focusing on the nondelegation doctrine, and Justice Kavanaugh wrote the principal dissent, which was joined by Justices Thomas and Alito.

### 3. Candidate Holdings

Two primary legal propositions were advanced to support the judgment. Only one achieved majority support and qualifies as a holding of the Court.

**Candidate 1: Statutory Interpretation of "Regulate"**
- **Proposition (HOLDING):** Under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the power to "regulate . . . importation" in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the distinct power to impose tariffs, which is a form of taxation (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-26).
- **Majority Support:** 6 Justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson).
- **Doctrinal Grounding:** Statutory Interpretation, Taxing Power.
- **Narrow Reading:** The term 'regulate' in 50 U. S. C. §1702(a)(1)(B) does not grant the President authority to impose tariffs, based on the text, structure, and context of IEEPA, where Congress did not use express terms like 'duty' or 'tax' as it consistently has in other statutes delegating such authority.
- **Broad Reading:** The executive power to 'regulate' a domain of commerce presumptively excludes the power to tax that domain unless Congress provides an explicit and separate grant of taxing authority.

**Candidate 2: Major Questions Doctrine**
- **Proposition (REASONING):** Because the President's assertion of authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under IEEPA is a matter of vast economic and political significance and a transformative expansion of executive authority, the major questions doctrine requires a "clear congressional authorization" for the power, which IEEPA lacks (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20).
- **Majority Support:** 3 Justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett).
- **Doctrinal Grounding:** Major Questions Doctrine, Clear Statement Rule, Separation of Powers, Congressional Delegation.
- **Narrow Reading:** The assertion of a novel, economy-altering tariff power under the general language of IEEPA triggers the major questions doctrine, requiring a clear statement of congressional authorization.
- **Broad Reading:** Any executive assertion of a major new power under a pre-existing statute that has significant economic and political effects requires a clear, specific congressional authorization.

### 4. Fracture Map

The decision reveals six significant fractures among the justices, with the **major questions doctrine** being the most contested area.

- **F1: Scope of "Regulate" (Statutory Interpretation)**
  - **Side A (6 Justices):** The power to "regulate...importation" does not include the power to impose tariffs, as taxation is a distinct power that Congress delegates expressly (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson) (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22).
  - **Side B (3 Justices):** The power to "regulate...importation" does include tariffs as a traditional tool of regulating importation (Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito) (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109).
  - **Severity:** Fundamental. This fracture directly explains the 6-3 split in the judgment.

- **F2: Necessity of the Major Questions Doctrine (Doctrinal)**
  - **Side A (3 Justices):** The major questions doctrine is the necessary framework for analysis (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-14).
  - **Side B (3 Justices):** The major questions doctrine is "unnecessary" because ordinary statutory interpretation resolves the case (Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson) (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 79-80).
  - **Severity:** Significant. This explains why the major questions analysis is non-binding plurality reasoning.

- **F3: Foundation of the Major Questions Doctrine (Doctrinal)**
  - **Side A (Justice Gorsuch):** The doctrine is a substantive canon rooted in the separation of powers and Article I's Vesting Clause (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0007, pp. 44-45).
  - **Side B (Justice Barrett):** The doctrine is an application of textualism that "situates text in context" and is not a substantive, value-external canon (24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001, p. 74).
  - **Severity:** Significant. This shows deep theoretical disagreement even within the plurality.

- **F4: Major Questions Doctrine and Foreign Affairs (Doctrinal)**
  - **Side A (3 Justices):** The doctrine applies because the peacetime tariff power belongs to "Congress alone" (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 19-20).
  - **Side B (3 Justices):** The doctrine "does not apply in the foreign affairs context," where Congress often delegates broad authority (Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito) (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0008, pp. 138-141).
  - **Severity:** Fundamental. The dissent argues for a categorical exception to the doctrine.

- **F5: Tariffs as "Core Legislative Power" (Nondelegation)**
  - **Side A (3 Justices):** The tariff power is a "branch of the taxing power" and a core legislative function, demanding a clear delegation (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, p. 14).
  - **Side B (Justice Thomas):** As a matter of original understanding, the power over import duties relates to external affairs and is *not* a "core legislative power," making it freely delegable (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98).
  - **Severity:** Fundamental. This rejects the entire constitutional premise of the plurality's reasoning.

- **F6: Use of Legislative History (Methodological)**
  - **Side A (Justice Jackson):** Courts "can, and should, consult a statute's legislative history" as strong evidence of congressional intent (24-1287_jackson_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 85).
  - **Side B (Justice Kavanaugh):** Committee reports should only be used to show factual awareness, not for "determining the meaning of IEEPA" (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0005, p. 124).
  - **Severity:** Significant.

### 5. Marks v. United States Analysis

*Marks* analysis is applicable because the six-justice majority fractured on the legal rationale for the judgment.

- **Rationale for Applicability:** A three-justice plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) relied on both statutory interpretation and the major questions doctrine. A three-justice concurrence (Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson) relied *only* on statutory interpretation. Because no single rationale commanded five votes, the holding is the "position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds."
- **Candidate for Narrowest Ground:** The position articulated by Justice Kagan is the narrowest ground. Her concurrence resolves the case solely on the basis of **ordinary statutory interpretation**, concluding that the text and context of IEEPA do not authorize tariffs and that invoking the major questions doctrine is "unnecessary" (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0002, pp. 29-30, describing Kagan's view).
- **Assessment:** This statutory interpretation ground is a logical subset of the plurality's reasoning; all six justices in the majority agree that the statute, as ordinarily interpreted, fails to authorize the tariffs. This makes it the common denominator and the controlling principle. The major questions doctrine analysis in Part II-A-2 of the Chief Justice's opinion is the reasoning of a plurality and is not a binding holding of the Court.
- **Ambiguity & Skepticism (per Invariant 7):** While this *Marks* analysis appears straightforward, its application is often contested. Lower courts may mistakenly cite the plurality's major questions reasoning as a holding because it appears in the "opinion of the Court." Furthermore, the deep theoretical divisions on the doctrine's foundation between Justice Gorsuch and Justice Barrett (Fracture F3) confirm that this rationale lacks the coherence to be a controlling rule. Reasonable analysts might also argue that the Court's increasing reliance on the doctrine gives the plurality's reasoning more weight than a traditional *Marks* analysis would suggest.

### 6. Doctrinal Implications

- **Statutory Interpretation:** The decision establishes a clear majority holding that the statutory power to "regulate" a field of commerce does not, by itself, include the power to tax it. Congress must delegate its **taxing power** explicitly (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-26).
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** The doctrine's development is left in a state of flux. While a plurality applied it, the decision creates no binding precedent on its use. The opinion highlights deep internal disagreements over its constitutional foundation (substantive canon vs. textualist aid) (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0007, pp. 44-45), and the dissent forcefully argues for a categorical **foreign affairs power** exception (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0008, pp. 138-141).
- **Nondelegation Doctrine:** Justice Thomas's dissent advances an originalist argument that the nondelegation doctrine's strictures do not apply to powers over "external affairs," such as imposing duties on imports, which he argues are not "core legislative power" (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98). This resists the entire premise of the plurality's separation-of-powers concerns.

### 7. Open Questions

The fractured nature of the decision leaves several critical questions unresolved for lower courts and future cases:

1.  **What is the controlling theory of the major questions doctrine?** Is it a constitutional substantive canon (Gorsuch) or an application of context-based textualism (Barrett)? The decision offers competing views from within the same plurality.
2.  **Does a "foreign affairs exception" to the major questions doctrine exist?** The dissent argues forcefully that it does, while the plurality rejects it in the context of tariffs. This remains a live issue.
3.  **What is the originalist scope of "core legislative power" under the nondelegation doctrine?** Justice Thomas's dissent challenges the foundational assumption that the tariff power is a non-delegable core legislative power, framing it instead as a delegable power over external relations.
4.  **How should courts weigh legislative history in statutory interpretation?** The separate opinions by Justice Jackson and Justice Kavanaugh underscore the continuing methodological divide on this issue.
