> **Query:** From a left-leaning institutional perspective that views Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump as a rebuke of Trumpism, identify where that interpretation is strongest, and where it is weakest. In particular: (a) What parts of the decision genuinely constrain unilateral executive power going forward? (b) What parts leave open paths for an administration to exercise equal or greater power with congressional cooperation? (c) Where, if anywhere, does the Court's reasoning risk entrenching executive authority rather than diminishing it? Ground the analysis in the opinions themselves, not in predicted political outcomes.

**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Senior Staff
**FROM:** Office of Institutional Analysis
**DATE:** 2026-02-20
**SUBJECT:** Institutional Analysis of *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* Regarding Unilateral Executive Power

This memorandum provides a structured analysis of the Supreme Court’s decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, focusing on its implications for unilateral executive power. The analysis is grounded exclusively in the legal reasoning articulated within the opinions, without addressing policy merits or inferring motives.

***

From an institutional perspective focused on constraining unilateral executive action, the decision in *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* presents a mixed but ultimately significant result. The interpretation of the decision as a strong "rebuke" is most robust in its binding holding but is weaker when considering the paths it leaves open and, most notably, the theories of executive power advanced in the dissents.

**(a) Parts of the Decision that Genuinely Constrain Unilateral Executive Power Going Forward**

The strength of the decision as a constraint on unilateral executive power lies in its binding six-justice majority **HOLDING**, which is grounded in **statutory interpretation**.

*   **Strict Construction of the Taxing Power:** The core holding establishes a durable rule of construction: broad statutory grants of regulatory authority, such as the power to "regulate," do not implicitly include the separate and distinct **taxing power** (HOLDING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22). The majority reasoned that "the ‘power to regulate commerce’ is ‘entirely distinct from the right to levy taxes’" (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 21). This prevents a future executive from unilaterally imposing tariffs or similar financial exactions by claiming they are an inherent tool of regulation under general-purpose statutes. This is a direct and durable constraint on presidential power over major economic policy.

*   **Reinforcement of Congressional Prerogative:** By emphasizing Congress's consistent historical practice of delegating tariff authority only through express and carefully limited terms, the majority reinforces the principle that the power of the purse originates with and must be clearly delegated by the legislature (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 14-15). This serves as a direct judicial check on executive attempts to find novel authority for revenue-raising measures in old, general-purpose statutes.

**(b) Parts of the Decision that Leave Open Paths for an Administration to Exercise Equal or Greater Power with Congressional Cooperation**

The decision constrains *unilateral* action based on *ambiguous* statutes; it does not prohibit the exercise of such power when properly authorized by Congress. This is where the interpretation of the decision as a complete check on executive power is weakest.

*   **Provides a Legislative Roadmap:** The majority opinion effectively provides a blueprint for a future Congress that wishes to delegate tariff authority. By specifying what was textually absent from IEEPA—an explicit mention of "duties" or "tariffs" and specific constraints on their use—the Court indicates that a future statute containing such clear language would likely be upheld (REASONING, 24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 20). The decision channels executive power by requiring it to secure explicit legislative cooperation rather than eliminating the power itself.

*   **Highlights Alternative Statutory Authorities:** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent notes that the decision does not eliminate the President's ability to impose tariffs, but rather clarifies that the wrong statutory authority was invoked. His opinion points out that "numerous other federal statutes authorize the President to impose tariffs" under different circumstances (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113). This suggests that an administration could achieve similar policy ends by utilizing these other, more specific congressional delegations.

**(c) Where, if Anywhere, Does the Court’s Reasoning Risk Entrenching Executive Authority Rather Than Diminishing It?**

While the binding holding constrains executive power, non-binding reasoning in the dissenting opinions presents theories that, if adopted by a future majority, could significantly entrench executive authority. These represent the greatest weakness in viewing the decision as a comprehensive rebuke.

*   **Justice Thomas's Nondelegation Argument:** In his dissent, Justice Thomas argues that the power to impose duties on imports is *not* "within the core legislative power" because it pertains to "external affairs" (REASONING, 24-1287_thomas_dissent_0005, p. 98). He concludes that Congress can therefore delegate this power to the President with fewer restrictions than would be required for domestic matters.
    *   **Risk:** If this view were to become law, it would create a two-tiered **nondelegation doctrine**, allowing for vast and unspecific delegations of power to the President in any area touching on the **foreign affairs power**. This would substantially weaken judicial checks on executive authority in a broad and critical domain.

*   **Justice Kavanaugh's Foreign Affairs Exception to the Major Questions Doctrine:** The principal dissent argues in the alternative that the **major questions doctrine** "does not apply in the foreign affairs context" (REASONING, 24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 113).
    *   **Risk:** Adoption of this position would carve out a categorical exception from the primary judicial tool used to police major assertions of executive authority under ambiguous statutes. It would prevent courts from demanding a clear statement from Congress for even the most significant executive actions in foreign policy or national security, thereby risking greater unilateral executive power in those fields.
