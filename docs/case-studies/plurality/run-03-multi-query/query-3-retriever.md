A lower court could plausibly misapply *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* by **misinterpreting the plurality's reasoning on the Major Questions Doctrine as the binding holding of the Court**, while claiming fidelity to the decision.

### Plausible Misapplication Scenario

1.  **Lower Court's Stated Adherence:** A lower court might face a new case involving an executive agency's significant regulatory action taken under broadly worded statutory authority, but *not* directly involving the imposition of tariffs or an explicit taxing power. The lower court, citing *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, might assert that the **major questions doctrine** requires "clear congressional authorization" for this executive action due to its "economic and political significance" and "transformative" nature, thereby invalidating the agency's action.
2.  **Claim of Fidelity:** The court would claim it is applying *Learning Resources* faithfully by relying on the major questions doctrine to police executive overreach, particularly where congressional delegation seems ambiguous.

### How this Constitutes Misapplication and Which Blocks Reveal It

This application would be a misapplication because it elevates a plurality's reasoning to the status of a binding holding, ignoring the actual narrowest ground of the *Learning Resources* decision.

1.  **The Actual Narrowest Controlling Principle:** The actual binding **HOLDING** of *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, which commanded a majority of six justices, is based on **statutory interpretation**:
    *   **HOLDING:** Under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the power to "regulate . . . importation" in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the distinct power to impose tariffs, which is a form of taxation (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-26).
    *   **Reasoning:** This holding rested on textual analysis, the omission of specific language for tariffs, congressional practice of expressly delegating taxing power, and constitutional avoidance concerns regarding taxing exports.

2.  **The Plurality's Non-Binding Reasoning:** The discussion of the **major questions doctrine** in Part II-A-2 of Chief Justice Roberts's opinion (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20) only commanded three votes (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) and is **REASONING**, not a **HOLDING**. This part reasoned that the assertion of tariff authority under IEEPA involved a "major question" due to its "vast economic and political significance" and "transformative expansion" of executive power, thus requiring "clear congressional authorization."

**Specific Blocks that Reveal the Misapplication:**

*   **24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001 (Justice Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, pp. 78-80):** This block explicitly states the crucial point of fracture: "But because I think the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result, I do not join the part of that opinion invoking the so-called major-questions doctrine." Justice Kagan clarifies that "The use of a clear-statement rule here is unnecessary because ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to the same result." This directly demonstrates that a three-justice bloc of the majority specifically *rejected the necessity* of the major questions doctrine in reaching the judgment.
*   **24-1287_roberts_majority_0001 (Chief Justice Roberts, p. 7):** This block contains the footnote specifying the partial joins: "*JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE JACKSON join only Parts I, II–A–1, and II–B of this opinion." This textual detail is critical. It visually confirms that Parts II-A-2 and III, which contain the major questions doctrine analysis, lacked majority support.
*   **24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0002 (Justice Gorsuch, pp. 29-30):** Justice Gorsuch, while a proponent of the major questions doctrine, acknowledges the position of Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson: "And rather than critique the doctrine, they say only that it is 'unnecessary' in this case 'because ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to the same result.'" This further highlights the fragmented reasoning.

By exclusively citing or overemphasizing the major questions doctrine discussion in **24-1287_roberts_majority_0005**, and neglecting the explicit limitations in **24-1287_roberts_majority_0001** (footnote) and the direct rejection of its necessity by three majority justices in **24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001**, a lower court would be misapplying *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*. The controlling precedent of the case is the narrower, six-justice majority's statutory interpretation, not the three-justice plurality's major questions doctrine reasoning.
