Produce a structured, non-partisan memorandum responding to the following critique of Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump:

Critique:
“The Supreme Court substituted its own economic policy preferences for the elected President’s judgment during a national emergency. IEEPA clearly allows regulation of imports. Tariffs are a traditional regulatory tool. The Court artificially narrowed executive authority, weakening America in the face of foreign threats.”

Instructions:

1. Do NOT defend or attack the policy merits of tariffs.
2. Do NOT attribute motive to the Court or to critics.
3. Use only reasoning grounded in the decision corpus.
4. Clearly distinguish:
   - statutory interpretation from policy disagreement,
   - emergency powers from taxing authority,
   - judicial review from policymaking.
5. Identify:
   - the binding holding,
   - the dissent’s position,
   - where reasonable legal disagreement exists.
6. Avoid evaluative adjectives.
7. Use clerical voice: justices and opinions are the actors.
8. If the critique conflates categories (e.g., regulation vs taxation), clarify without labeling it as an error.
9. Conclude with a brief structural explanation of how separation of powers operates in this context.
