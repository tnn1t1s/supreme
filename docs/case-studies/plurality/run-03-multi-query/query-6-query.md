**From a left-leaning institutional perspective that views Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump as a rebuke of Trumpism, identify where that interpretation is strongest, and where it is weakest. In particular:

(a) What parts of the decision genuinely constrain unilateral executive power going forward?

(b) What parts of the decision leave open paths for an administration—this one or a future one—to exercise equal or greater power with congressional cooperation?

(c) Where, if anywhere, does the Court’s reasoning risk entrenching executive authority rather than diminishing it?

Ground the analysis in the opinions themselves, not in predicted political outcomes.**
