  "marks_applicable": true,
  "marks_rationale": "Marks analysis is applicable because the 6-justice majority that agreed on the judgment fractured on the underlying legal rationale. A 3-justice plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) relied on both the major questions doctrine (Part II-A-2 of the Chief Justice's opinion) and ordinary statutory interpretation (Part II-B). A 3-justice concurrence (Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson) explicitly declined to join the major questions doctrine analysis, resting its conclusion solely on ordinary statutory interpretation. Therefore, no single rationale commanded a majority of the Court, requiring an analysis to find the 'narrowest ground' that explains the judgment.",

        "position": "The case is resolved on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation. The term 'regulate . . . importation' in IEEPA, when analyzed via text and context, does not grant tariff authority. Resorting to the major questions doctrine is 'unnecessary' to reach this result.",

        "why_narrowest": "This position is logically narrower because it resolves the case using a standard and less controversial tool (statutory interpretation) without invoking a broader, constitutionally-inflected clear statement rule (the major questions doctrine). The plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) also agrees with the statutory interpretation conclusion, making it the common denominator and a logical subset of their broader reasoning. All six justices who concurred in the judgment agree that the statute, as ordinarily interpreted, does not authorize tariffs; only three of them add the major questions doctrine as an additional reason.",
        "counterargument": "A counterargument could be that for the three plurality justices, the major questions doctrine was the primary or essential analytical framework, not an alternative one. However, under a standard application of Marks, when one ground is sufficient to dispose of the case and is a logical subset of a broader, multi-part ground, the narrower ground controls.",

    ],
    "assessment": "The Marks analysis in this case yields a clear answer. The controlling holding of the Court is the narrower ground of statutory interpretation, a position that commands a full 6-justice majority. The proposition that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs based on the text, structure, and context of the statute is the binding rule. The major questions doctrine analysis from Part II-A-2 of the Chief Justice's opinion is the reasoning of a 3-justice plurality and does not constitute a holding of the Court.",
    "ambiguity_factors": [
      "The primary source of potential ambiguity is that the non-binding plurality reasoning (major questions doctrine) is located within the opinion designated as the 'opinion of the Court'. Lower courts might mistakenly cite it as a majority holding.",
      "The deep theoretical disagreements between Justices Gorsuch and Barrett on the nature of the major questions doctrine itself (Fracture F3) further confirm that this part of the Chief Justice's opinion does not represent a coherent, controlling rationale.",
      "Invariant 7 (MARKS SKEPTICISM): While the analysis here is straightforward, the application of Marks is always subject to debate, and some might argue that the Court's increasing use of the major questions doctrine makes the plurality's reasoning more significant than a traditional Marks analysis would suggest."
    ]
  },
  "practical_impact": "Lower courts must treat the statutory interpretation principle articulated in Part II-B of the Chief Justice's opinion (Holding H1) as the binding precedent from this case. Specifically, the power to 'regulate...importation' under IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. Courts should not treat the plurality's major questions doctrine reasoning from Part II-A-2 as binding. While it may be cited as persuasive authority reflecting the views of three justices, it is not the law of the land established by this case."
