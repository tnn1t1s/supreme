C. §1702(a)(1)(B) does not grant the President authority to impose tariffs, based on the text, structure, and context of IEEPA, where Congress did not use express terms like 'duty' or 'tax' as it consistently has in other statutes delegating such authority.",

      "notes": "This is the narrowest controlling principle that commands a majority of the Court. It is grounded in Part II-B of the Chief Justice's opinion. The concurrence by Justice Kagan (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) explicitly agrees with this reasoning, stating that 'ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to the same result' (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 79-80). The dissent by Justice Kavanaugh (joined by Thomas and Alito) explicitly rejects this holding, arguing that as a matter of ordinary meaning and historical usage, the power to 'regulate . . . importation' does include tariffs (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 108-109)."

      "id": "H2",
      "proposition": "Because the President's assertion of authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under IEEPA is a matter of vast economic and political significance and a transformative expansion of executive authority, the major questions doctrine requires a 'clear congressional authorization' for the power, which IEEPA lacks.",

      "narrow_reading": "The assertion of a novel, economy-altering tariff power under the general language of IEEPA triggers the major questions doctrine, requiring a clear statement of congressional authorization.",
      "broad_reading": "Any executive assertion of a major new power under a pre-existing statute that has significant economic and political effects requires a clear, specific congressional authorization.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "This is the reasoning of a 3-justice plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) from Part II-A-2 and is NOT a holding of the Court. Justice Kagan's concurrence (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) explicitly resists this reasoning as 'unnecessary' (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 79). Justice Barrett's concurrence resists the plurality's foundational theory, arguing the doctrine is not a substantive canon but an application of textualism that situates text in context (24-1287_barrett_concurrence_0001, p. 74). Justice Kavanaugh's dissent rejects this reasoning on two grounds: first, that IEEPA's text, history, and precedent *do* provide clear authorization, and second, that the major questions doctrine should not apply in the foreign affairs context (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 112-113). Justice Thomas's dissent rejects the premise entirely, arguing the power to impose duties on imports is not a 'core legislative power' and thus can be delegated without requiring a clear statement (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0001, p. 91-92)."

The judgment of the District Court for the District of Columbia is vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.",
