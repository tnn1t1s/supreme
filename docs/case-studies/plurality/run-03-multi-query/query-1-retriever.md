C. §1702(a)(1)(B), does not authorize the President to unilaterally impose tariffs. \n\nHOLDING (Statutory Interpretation): The term “regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA does not include the power to tax or impose tariffs. Congress’s consistent practice is to grant tariff powers explicitly and with careful constraints, which is absent from IEEPA.\n\nREASONING (Major Questions Doctrine): The assertion of tariff authority under IEEPA constitutes a “major question” due to the “highly consequential power” involved, the “transformative expansion of the President’s authority,” “lack of historical precedent,” and “economic and political significance.” Such significant delegations require “clear congressional authorization,” which IEEPA lacks.\n\nREASONING (Constitutional Avoidance): A reading of IEEPA that includes tariffs on exports would render it partly unconstitutional, as taxation of exports is forbidden by Art. I, §9, cl. 5."

Congress consistently grants tariff powers expressly and with constraints. The ordinary meaning of “regulate” does not include taxation. If “regulate” were as broad as suggested, other verbs in §1702(a)(1)(B) would be redundant. The Government cannot identify any statute where “regulate” includes the power to tax. Tariffs are different in kind, not degree, from other authorities in IEEPA and fall squarely within the taxing power, not within the spectrum of "compel" to "prohibit." Arguments based on IEEPA's predecessor (TWEA) and historical precedents are unavailing."

Congress has historically delegated tariff powers in explicit and limited terms, unlike the broad language of IEEPA."

He notes that the Court today does not claim that the phrase “regulate . . . importation” on its own excludes tariffs as a matter of ordinary statutory meaning. He then discusses the major questions doctrine, which he supports, but believes it is satisfied here or, in the alternative, not applicable.\n\nRESISTANCE to Major Questions Doctrine's Scope (Foreign Affairs Exception): He argues that, in the alternative, the major questions doctrine “does not apply in the foreign affairs context.” In this realm, courts should engage in “routine” textualist statutory interpretation and “not employ the major questions doctrine as a thumb on the scale against the President.”"
