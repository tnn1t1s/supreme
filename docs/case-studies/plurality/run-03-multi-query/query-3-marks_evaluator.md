A lower court could plausibly misapply *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* by **elevating the three-justice plurality's reasoning on the Major Questions Doctrine to the status of a binding holding of the Court**, while claiming fidelity to the decision.

### Plausible Misapplication Scenario

1.  **Factual Context:** A lower court faces a case concerning a novel and economically significant regulatory action by an executive agency. The agency's action is not a tax or tariff, but it is based on a broad, decades-old statutory grant of authority to regulate a specific sector of the economy.
2.  **Lower Court's Stated Adherence:** The lower court, claiming to faithfully apply *Learning Resources*, quotes exclusively from Part II-A-2 of Chief Justice Roberts's opinion. It states that because the agency's action has "vast economic and political significance" and represents a "transformative expansion" of its authority, the **major questions doctrine** requires a "clear congressional authorization" that the broad statutory text does not provide.
3.  **Claim of Fidelity:** The court would invalidate the agency action, asserting that it is compelled to do so by the Supreme Court's precedent in *Learning Resources*, which it characterizes as a landmark major questions doctrine decision.

### How This Constitutes Misapplication and Which Blocks Reveal It

This application is a misapplication because it mistakes a three-justice plurality's **REASONING** for the six-justice majority's binding **HOLDING**. The actual controlling principle of the case is narrower and grounded in ordinary statutory interpretation.

1.  **The Actual Narrowest Controlling Principle (The HOLDING):** The binding **HOLDING** in *Learning Resources*, which commanded a majority of six justices, is a principle of **statutory interpretation** concerning the **taxing power**.
    *   **HOLDING:** The authority to "regulate . . . importation" in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not include the power to impose tariffs, because the power to tax is distinct from the power to regulate and Congress has a consistent practice of delegating its tariff power explicitly and with specific limits (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22).

2.  **The Plurality's Non-Binding Reasoning:** The discussion of the **major questions doctrine** in Part II-A-2 of Chief Justice Roberts's opinion is the **REASONING** of only three justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) and is therefore not a holding of the Court (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20).

**Specific Blocks that Reveal the Misapplication:**

A lower court making this error would have to ignore the following textual evidence from the decision itself:

*   **24-1287_roberts_majority_0001 (p. 7):** This block contains the single most important piece of textual evidence for a proper application of the decision. The footnote explicitly limits the join structure of the opinion: "*JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE JACKSON join only Parts I, II–A–1, and II–B of this opinion.*"
    *   **Significance:** This footnote is dispositive proof that the major questions doctrine analysis in Part II-A-2 did not command a majority of the Court and is not a holding. A lower court claiming fidelity to the decision cannot ignore this explicit textual instruction.

*   **24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001 (pp. 78-79):** This block contains the explicit rejection of the plurality's reasoning by three members of the majority.
    *   **Key Text:** "But because I think the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result, **I do not join the part of that opinion invoking the so-called major-questions doctrine.**" Justice Kagan further states, "The use of a clear-statement rule here is **unnecessary** because ordinary principles of statutory interpretation lead to the same result."
    *   **Significance:** This block demonstrates that the narrowest ground for the judgment, per *Marks v. United States*, is the statutory interpretation argument that all six justices in the majority agreed upon. It confirms that the major questions doctrine was not essential to the outcome for half of the majority.

*   **24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0001 (p. 28):** Justice Gorsuch, a member of the plurality, acknowledges the fracture in his opening paragraph.
    *   **Key Text:** "Past critics of the major questions doctrine...insist, they can reach the same result by employing only routine tools of statutory interpretation. *Post*, at 1 (KAGAN, J., joined by SOTOMAYOR and JACKSON, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)."
    *   **Significance:** This acknowledgment from within the plurality group further solidifies that the Court was consciously fractured on this point. It reinforces that there are two distinct paths to the judgment, only one of which (statutory interpretation) commanded a majority.

A lower court that over-relies on **24-1287_roberts_majority_0005** (the major questions doctrine analysis) while ignoring the clear textual limitations in **24-1287_roberts_majority_0001** and the explicit rationale of three justices in the majority in **24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001** would be misapplying the precedent. The controlling holding of *Learning Resources* is the narrower statutory ground, not the broader major questions doctrine reasoning.
