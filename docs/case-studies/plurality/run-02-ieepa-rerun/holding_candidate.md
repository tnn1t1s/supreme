While the explicit statement 'we hold...' appears in a 3-justice plurality section (Part III), it accurately reflects the outcome supported by all six justices in the majority, who arrived at the conclusion via two different lines of reasoning."

      "proposition": "The power to 'regulate' in a statute does not ordinarily include the power to tax. Tariffs are a form of tax, and when Congress delegates the authority to impose them, it does so with clear and specific language (e.g., using terms like 'duty' or 'tariff'), not through a general grant of regulatory authority.",

      "broad_reading": "A statutory grant to an executive agency to 'regulate' an area of commerce presumptively excludes the power to impose taxes or tariffs related to that area unless the statute provides an explicit, separate grant of taxing authority.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "This reasoning, from a majority section of the opinion (Part II-B), is a crucial step for all six justices in the majority. It is grounded in ordinary statutory interpretation principles, distinguishing it from the plurality's major questions rationale."

      "broad_reading": "The major questions doctrine applies with special force to claimed delegations of Congress's core constitutional powers, such as the power of the purse, and is not displaced by the statute's subject matter being foreign affairs or a national emergency.",
