  "marks_rationale": "Yes, Marks analysis is applicable. While a six-justice majority agreed on the judgment that IEEPA does not authorize presidential tariffs, their reasoning was fractured. As detailed in the join structure and fracture analysis (F2), three justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) reached the conclusion by applying the major questions doctrine (H4), while three other justices (Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson) reached the same conclusion through ordinary statutory interpretation, explicitly declining to join the major questions section of the lead opinion. Because no single rationale commanded a five-justice majority, the holding must be determined by finding the 'narrowest ground' among the justices who concurred in the judgment.",

        "why_narrowest": "Justice Kagan's reasoning is logically narrower because it resolves the case using conventional and universally applied methods of statutory interpretation. The plurality's reliance on the major questions doctrine adds a further, more demanding, and more constitutionally freighted interpretive layer that is only applied in extraordinary circumstances. The Kagan concurrence's ground is a logical subset of the plurality's; one must always conduct ordinary statutory interpretation, and only if that is inconclusive or raises grave constitutional doubts would one then proceed to apply a clear statement rule like the major questions doctrine. By stopping at the first step, the concurrence rests on a narrower basis.",
        "counterargument": "A possible counterargument is that the plurality's major-questions-based holding is narrower because it applies only to this specific, extraordinary assertion of power under IEEPA, leaving the meaning of 'regulate' untouched in other, less significant contexts. However, this argument misinterprets the `Marks` test, which focuses on the narrowness of the legal rule applied, not the scope of its factual application. Resolving a case on statutory grounds is consistently held to be narrower than resolving it on quasi-constitutional or 'substantive canon' grounds.",

    "assessment": "The Marks analysis in this case yields a reasonably clear answer. The controlling rationale for the judgment is Justice Kagan's concurrence, which is joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson. Their reasoning, grounded in ordinary statutory interpretation, is the narrowest ground for the holding that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.",
    "ambiguity_factors": [
      "Pursuant to Invariant 7 (MARKS SKEPTICISM), the application of Marks is never entirely free from ambiguity. The primary ambiguity here stems from the ongoing debate about the precise nature of the major questions doctrine itself. If, as Justice Barrett's concurrence suggests, the doctrine is merely a sub-species of ordinary textualism rather than a distinct clear statement rule, the distinction between the plurality and Kagan concurrence's reasoning could be seen as a matter of degree, not of kind. This could complicate the 'logical subset' analysis, although the prevailing view would still favor the Kagan concurrence as narrower."
    ]
  },
  "practical_impact": "Lower courts will treat the core proposition that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs (H1) as a binding holding of the Court, supported by six justices. They will also treat the majority-supported reasoning in H2 (the distinction between 'regulate' and 'tax') and H3 (the characterization of tariffs as a taxing power) as binding. However, the controlling rationale for the judgment will be Justice Kagan's opinion. The plurality's extensive discussion of the major questions doctrine (H4) will be treated as non-binding dicta. Therefore, this case will be binding precedent for the specific interpretation of IEEPA, but it will not establish a new binding precedent on the scope or application of the major questions doctrine, particularly in the realm of foreign affairs or emergency powers."
