### **Analysis of *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump***
**Docket:** 24-1287, 25-250
**Decision Date:** 2026-02-20

---

### 1. Query & Scope

This analysis addresses the central question: **Does the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authorize the President to impose tariffs?**

The analysis is based on the full Supreme Court decision corpus for *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, which comprises 53 blocks of text from 8 distinct opinions (syllabus, majority, 2 concurrences, 2 concurrences in part, and 2 dissents). The conclusions are grounded in a set of 20 blocks retrieved using the search terms "IEEPA," "tariffs," "President," and "authorize."

### 2. Vote Structure & Joins

The Court held 6-3 that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The judgment affirmed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and vacated the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia's judgment with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

The opinion structure is fractured:

*   **Majority Opinion:** Chief Justice Roberts authored the opinion of the Court.
    *   Justices **Gorsuch** and **Barrett** joined the opinion in full.
    *   Justices **Sotomayor**, **Kagan**, and **Jackson** joined only Parts I, II-A-1, and II-B. They crucially did *not* join Parts II-A-2 and III, which rely on the major questions doctrine to reach the outcome (24-1287_syllabus_syllabus_0002, p. 6).

*   **Concurrences:**
    *   Justice **Gorsuch** and Justice **Barrett** each filed separate concurring opinions.
    *   Justice **Kagan**, joined by Justices **Sotomayor** and **Jackson**, filed an opinion concurring in part and in the judgment. This opinion agreed with the outcome but rejected the plurality's reliance on the major questions doctrine, arguing that ordinary statutory interpretation was sufficient (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 78).
    *   Justice **Jackson** also filed a separate opinion concurring in part and in the judgment, emphasizing the value of legislative history.

*   **Dissents:**
    *   Justice **Thomas** filed a dissenting opinion.
    *   Justice **Kavanaugh** filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices **Thomas** and **Alito**. This dissent argued that IEEPA does authorize tariffs (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 108-109).

This structure results in a 6-justice majority for the judgment but only a 3-justice plurality for the reasoning based on the major questions doctrine.

### 3. Candidate Holdings

The following propositions were identified from the decision's text and join structure:

*   **H1: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.**
    *   **Classification:** HOLDING
    *   **Majority Support:** 6 (Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, Jackson)
    *   **Doctrines:** Statutory Interpretation, Emergency Powers
    *   **Narrow Reading:** The specific grant of authority in IEEPA to "regulate...importation" does not encompass the power to impose tariffs.
    *   **Broad Reading:** Broad, general delegations of power to the Executive in the foreign affairs and emergency contexts will be construed narrowly to exclude core congressional powers like taxation unless Congress has spoken with explicit clarity.
    *   **Source:** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0007, p. 27)

*   **R1: The statutory power to 'regulate' a subject does not ordinarily include the power to tax it. Congress consistently grants the authority to tax separately and expressly from the authority to regulate.**
    *   **Classification:** REASONING
    *   **Majority Support:** 6 (Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, Jackson)
    *   **Doctrines:** Statutory Interpretation, Taxing Power
    *   **Narrow Reading:** In the specific context of IEEPA, the term 'regulate' in the phrase 'regulate...importation' does not include the power to impose tariffs, given the absence of any express mention of 'tariffs' or 'duties' and the distinct constitutional nature of the taxing power.
    *   **Broad Reading:** As a general principle of statutory interpretation, a congressional grant of authority to an executive agency to 'regulate' an area of commerce presumptively excludes the power to tax that commerce unless the power to tax is also conferred explicitly.
    *   **Source:** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22)

*   **R2: A claimed executive power of vast 'economic and political significance' requires a clear and explicit congressional authorization. The President's assertion of unilateral power to impose tariffs of unlimited amount and duration under IEEPA is such a claim, and the statute's general grant of authority to 'regulate...importation' is not sufficiently clear authorization.**
    *   **Classification:** REASONING (Plurality)
    *   **Majority Support:** 3 (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett)
    *   **Doctrines:** Major Questions, Clear Statement Rule, Separation of Powers
    *   **Narrow Reading:** Because the power to impose tariffs of the magnitude seen here has not been historically exercised under IEEPA and because Congress has elsewhere delegated tariff authority with great specificity, the general language of IEEPA does not provide the required clear authorization.
    *   **Broad Reading:** The major questions doctrine applies with full force to emergency and foreign affairs statutes, requiring clear congressional delegation for any executive action with vast economic and political consequences, even in areas where the President traditionally has broad discretion.
    *   **Source:** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20)

*   **R3: Tariffs are a branch of the taxing power, a power the Constitution vests exclusively in Congress in Article I, Section 8.**
    *   **Classification:** REASONING
    *   **Majority Support:** 6 (Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, Jackson)
    *   **Doctrines:** Taxing Power, Separation of Powers
    *   **Narrow Reading:** The President has no inherent constitutional authority to impose tariffs in peacetime; any such authority must be delegated by Congress.
    *   **Broad Reading:** Any claimed delegation of the taxing power to the Executive must be scrutinized carefully due to its foundational placement as a legislative power in the Constitution's structure.
    *   **Source:** (24-1287_roberts_majority_0004, pp. 11-12)

### 4. Fracture Map

The decision contains several significant fractures between and within the majority and dissent.

*   **F1: Doctrinal disagreement within the majority (Major Questions vs. Statutory Interpretation).** [Severity: Fundamental]
    *   **Side A (Plurality):** Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, argued that the President's claimed authority triggered the **major questions doctrine**, requiring a clear statement of congressional authorization which was absent (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 13-20).
    *   **Side B (Concurrence):** Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, explicitly rejected the need to invoke the major questions doctrine, concluding that "ordinary principles of statutory interpretation" were sufficient to resolve the case (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 78-80).

*   **F2: Scope of "regulate...importation".** [Severity: Fundamental]
    *   **Side A (Majority):** All six justices in the majority agreed that the power to "regulate" does not include the power to tax, and that tariffs are a form of taxation distinct from the other powers enumerated in IEEPA (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 20-22).
    *   **Side B (Dissent):** Justice Kavanaugh, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, argued that the power to "regulate...importation" naturally includes traditional tools of trade regulation like tariffs, alongside quotas and embargoes, and that reading the statute otherwise "does not make much sense" (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 111).

*   **F3: Factual disagreement on historical context.** [Severity: Significant]
    *   **Side A (Majority):** The majority dismissed the significance of a 1975 appellate court decision upholding President Nixon's tariffs under IEEPA's precursor, TWEA, stating a "single, expressly limited opinion" did not create a "well-settled" meaning for Congress to adopt (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 23-24).
    *   **Side B (Dissent):** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent argued that the Nixon and Ford tariffs, and related court decisions, created a clear context in 1977 where "Congress and the public plainly would have understood" that the power to "regulate...importation" included tariffs (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, pp. 109-110).

*   **F4: Doctrinal disagreement on a foreign affairs exception to the major questions doctrine.** [Severity: Significant]
    *   **Side A (Plurality):** The Roberts plurality explicitly rejected a foreign affairs exception to the doctrine, noting that the power to impose peacetime tariffs was given to "Congress alone" (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 18-19).
    *   **Side B (Dissent):** Justice Kavanaugh argued that the Court had "never before applied the major questions doctrine in the foreign affairs context" and that it should not be used as "a thumb on the scale against the President" in this domain (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 112).

*   **F5: Methodological disagreement on legislative history.** [Severity: Minor]
    *   **Side A (Concurrence):** Justice Jackson argued that legislative history provides "the best evidence of what Congress sought to accomplish" and showed IEEPA was intended to grant power to freeze assets, not impose tariffs (24-1287_jackson_concurrence_in_part_0001, pp. 85-87).
    *   **Side B (Dissent):** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent explicitly "decline[d] the help of legislative history," focusing instead on the public meaning of the text (24-1287_jackson_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 88, citing dissent).

*   **F6: Doctrinal disagreement on the nondelegation doctrine.** [Severity: Significant]
    *   **Side A (Concurrence):** Justice Gorsuch suggested that delegating such a broad tariff power would raise serious nondelegation doctrine concerns (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0013, pp. 57-58).
    *   **Side B (Dissent):** Justice Thomas argued that the power to impose duties on imports is not a "core legislative power" and is therefore delegable to the President consistent with the original understanding of the Constitution (24-1287_thomas_dissent_0001, pp. 90-91).

### 5. *Marks v. United States* Analysis

*   **Applicability:** *Marks* analysis is required because a majority of justices agreed on the judgment (that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs) but did not agree on a single rationale. The 6-justice majority is split 3-3 between a rationale based on the major questions doctrine and one based on ordinary statutory interpretation.

*   **Narrowest Ground:** The reasoning articulated by Justice Kagan (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) represents the narrowest ground for the decision. Her position, which relies solely on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation (R1, R3), is a logical subset of the plurality's reasoning. The plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) agrees with the statutory interpretation argument *and* adds the separate, broader requirement of the major questions doctrine (R2). The statutory interpretation reasoning is the common denominator on which all six justices in the majority concur, making it the binding holding under *Marks* (24-1287_kagan_concurrence_in_part_0001, p. 78).

*   **Ambiguity and Assessment:** While the application of *Marks* is often contested and ambiguous, the analysis here is reasonably clear. The logical subset structure—where the plurality's reasoning (Statutory Interpretation + Major Questions) fully contains the concurrence's reasoning (Statutory Interpretation only)—points decisively to the concurrence's rationale as the narrowest ground.

*   **Practical Impact:** Lower courts are definitively bound by the holding that **IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs** (H1). The controlling legal rule is that, based on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the term "regulate...importation" in IEEPA does not encompass the power to tax (R1, R3). The plurality's reasoning concerning the **major questions doctrine is not a binding holding of the Court** and does not have the force of precedent.

### 6. Doctrinal Implications

*   **Statutory Interpretation:** The decision establishes as a majority-backed principle that a statutory grant of authority to "regulate" an area does not, without more, include the power to tax it. The Court emphasized that Congress delegates its taxing power specifically and expressly (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, pp. 21-22).
*   **Major Questions Doctrine:** The doctrine's scope remains unsettled. The 3-justice plurality's opinion sought to apply it robustly, even in the context of foreign affairs and national emergencies (24-1287_roberts_majority_0005, pp. 18-19). However, because this view did not command a majority, the decision leaves open the question of whether there is a foreign affairs exception to the doctrine. The fundamental split between the plurality and Justice Kagan's concurrence ensures this debate will continue.
*   **Emergency Powers & Foreign Affairs Power:** The holding directly curtails the President's toolkit under IEEPA. While the dissent argued for broad presidential discretion in this area (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 112), the majority subjected the statute to traditional interpretive rules, signaling a reluctance to infer vast executive power from general statutory language, even in emergencies.
*   **Nondelegation Doctrine:** This doctrine was not dispositive, but the dueling opinions from Justice Gorsuch and Justice Thomas highlight a deep and ongoing debate on the Court about which congressional powers are "core legislative" functions that cannot be delegated (24-1287_gorsuch_concurrence_0013, pp. 57-58; 24-1287_thomas_dissent_0001, pp. 90-91).

### 7. Open Questions

The decision leaves several key questions unresolved for lower courts and future administrations:

*   **The Scope of "Regulate":** The majority explicitly declined to define the full "metes and bounds" of the President's power to "regulate...importation" under IEEPA, stating the question was "not at issue" (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 22). This leaves ambiguity about what non-tariff regulatory actions are permissible.
*   **The Future of the Major Questions Doctrine:** With a 3-3 split on its application within the majority, the doctrine's precedential force and its application to foreign affairs and emergency statutes remain highly uncertain.
*   **Alternative Statutory Authorities:** Justice Kavanaugh's dissent suggests that other statutes might authorize the same tariffs, effectively arguing the President "checked the wrong statutory box" (24-1287_kavanaugh_dissent_0001, p. 112). The majority did not address this, leaving the legality of these tariffs under other statutes an open question.
*   **The Nondelegation Doctrine's Revival:** The stark disagreement between Justices Gorsuch and Thomas indicates that foundational questions about Congress's ability to delegate its powers, particularly over foreign commerce and taxation, are live issues that may be revisited by the Court.
