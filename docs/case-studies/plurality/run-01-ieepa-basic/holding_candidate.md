It is explicitly stated in the final part of the Chief Justice's opinion: 'we hold that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.' (24-1287_roberts_majority_0007, p. 27). While this section was only joined by a 3-justice plurality, the join structure and Justice Kagan's concurrence, on behalf of three justices, confirm agreement with this ultimate conclusion.

      "narrow_reading": "In the specific context of IEEPA, the term 'regulate' in the phrase 'regulate...importation' does not include the power to impose tariffs, given the absence of any express mention of 'tariffs' or 'duties' and the distinct constitutional nature of the taxing power.",
      "broad_reading": "As a general principle of statutory interpretation, a congressional grant of authority to an executive agency to 'regulate' an area of commerce presumptively excludes the power to tax that commerce unless the power to tax is also conferred explicitly.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "This is the core statutory interpretation reasoning that commands a 6-justice majority. It forms the narrowest ground for the decision under Marks v. United States, as it is the proposition of law on which all justices in the majority agree. The opinion notes the government could not identify any statute where the power to regulate includes the power to tax (24-1287_roberts_majority_0006, p. 21)."

The President's assertion of unilateral power to impose tariffs of unlimited amount and duration under IEEPA is such a claim, and the statute's general grant of authority to 'regulate...importation' is not sufficiently clear authorization.",

      "narrow_reading": "Because the power to impose tariffs of the magnitude seen here has not been historically exercised under IEEPA and because Congress has elsewhere delegated tariff authority with great specificity, the general language of IEEPA does not provide the required clear authorization.",
      "broad_reading": "The major questions doctrine applies with full force to emergency and foreign affairs statutes, requiring clear congressional delegation for any executive action with vast economic and political consequences, even in areas where the President traditionally has broad discretion.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "notes": "This reasoning is from a 3-justice plurality (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) and is NOT a holding of the Court. The other three justices in the majority (Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson) explicitly declined to join this part of the opinion, resolving the case on narrower statutory interpretation grounds alone.
