As they interpret the statute, the President\ncould, for example, block all imports from China but cannot\norder even a $1 tariff on goods imported from China.\nThat approach does not make much sense. Properly read,\nIEEPA does not draw such an odd distinction between\nquotas and embargoes on the one hand and tariffs on the\nother. Rather, it empowers the President to regulate\nimports during national emergencies with the tools\nPresidents have traditionally and commonly used,\nincluding quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.\nThe Court today nonetheless concludes otherwise and\nholds that IEEPA does not authorize the President to\nimpose tariffs to deal with the declared drug trafficking and\ntrade deficit emergencies. But the Court’s decision is\nsplintered. In today’s six-Justice majority, three Justices\n(JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, JUSTICE KAGAN, and JUSTICE\nJACKSON) interpret IEEPA not to authorize tariffs as a\nmatter of ordinary statutory interpretation. I disagree for\nthe reasons noted above and elaborated on at length in this\nopinion.\nThree other Justices (THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE\nGORSUCH, and JUSTICE BARRETT) lean on the major\nquestions canon of statutory interpretation to resolve this\ncase.

I\ndisagree. In accord with Judge Taranto’s careful and\npersuasive opinion in the Federal Circuit, I would conclude\nthat the President’s power under IEEPA to “regulate . . .\nimportation” encompasses tariffs. As a matter of ordinary\nmeaning, including dictionary definitions and historical\nusage, the broad power to “regulate . . . importation”\nincludes the traditional and common means to do so—in\nparticular, quotas, embargoes, and tariffs.\nHistory and precedent confirm that conclusion. In 1971,\nPresident Nixon imposed 10 percent tariffs on almost all\nforeign imports. He levied the tariffs under IEEPA’s\npredecessor statute, the Trading with the Enemy Act,\nwhich similarly authorized the President to “regulate\n. . . importation.” The Nixon tariffs were upheld in court.\nMoreover, in 1976, a year before IEEPA was enacted, this\nCourt unanimously ruled that a similarly worded statute\nauthorizing the President to “adjust the imports” permitted\nPresident Ford to impose monetary exactions on foreign oil\nimports. See Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin\nSNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548 (1976) (Algonquin).\nFor both the Nixon tariffs and the Ford tariffs upheld by\nthis Court in Algonquin, the relevant statutory provisions\ndid not specifically refer to “tariffs” or “duties,” but instead\nmore broadly authorized the President to “regulate . . .\nimportation” or to “adjust the imports.” Therefore, when\nIEEPA was enacted in 1977 in the wake of the Nixon and\nFord tariffs and the Algonquin decision, Congress and the\npublic plainly would have understood that the power to\n“regulate . . . importation” included tariffs.

The plaintiffs\nand the Court do not dispute that the President can act in\ndeclared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or\neven total embargoes on all imports from a given country.\nBut the President supposedly cannot take the far more\nmodest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a\ntariff or duty.\nTextually, however, if quotas and embargoes are a means\nto regulate importation, how are tariffs not a means to\nregulate importation? Nothing in the text supports such an\nillogical distinction.\nAnd it does not make much sense to think that IEEPA\nallows the President in a declared national emergency to,\nfor example, shut off all or most imports from China, but\nnot to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China. As\nJudge Taranto forcefully pointed out in the Federal Circuit,\ntariffs are “just a less extreme, more flexible tool for\npursuing the same objective of controlling the amount or\nprice of imports that, after all, could be barred altogether.”\n149 F. 4th, at 1363 (dissenting opinion). All of that explains\nwhy this Court in Algonquin definitively rejected such a\nstrange slice-and-dice approach to the President’s statutory\npower to “adjust” imports. If quotas and embargoes are\nauthorized, so are tariffs.\nIn short, whether through prohibiting imports via\nembargoes or regulating the quantity of imports through\nquotas or regulating the price of imports with tariffs,\nCongress granted the President flexibility in declared\nnational emergencies to take various actions affecting\nimports of foreign goods. The plaintiffs and the Court have\nno coherent textual or commonsensical explanation for why\na rational Congress would, in such a momentous and\ncarefully considered statute as IEEPA, grant the President\nthe power to impose quotas and embargoes, but not tariffs,\n"

As I see it, those\nfactors show that Congress clearly authorized tariffs in\nIEEPA when it empowered the President to “regulate . . .\nimportation.”\nFirst, unlike the OSHA vaccine mandate in NFIB or the\ngreenhouse gas regulation in Utility Air, for example, the\nPresident here is not exercising an “unheralded” or\n“newfound authority” based on a “long-extant” statute—\nthat is, exercising a power that was unanticipated or\nunforeseen when Congress enacted IEEPA’s “regulate . . .\nimportation” language in 1977.\nOn the contrary, as was fully explained above, the tariff\nauthority exercised here is not remotely “unheralded.” To\nrecap: Any citizen or Member of Congress who paid the\nleast bit of attention in 1977 would have readily understood\nthat the President’s authority to “regulate . . . importation”\nencompassed the power to tariff. There are the dictionary\ndefinitions and the historical usage and practice. And\namong other things, just a few years before IEEPA, that\n“regulate . . . importation” language was invoked by\nPresident Nixon and judicially approved to sustain his 10\npercent worldwide tariffs.

      "text_preview": "Two additional historical points strongly reinforce that\nanalysis of text and precedent and further demonstrate\nthat “regulate . . . importation” in IEEPA encompasses\ntariffs.\nFirst, U. S. history from the 1800s through IEEPA’s 1977\nenactment illustrates how the statute came to incorporate\nthe President’s long-recognized authority to impose tariffs\nduring wartime and then also during peacetime national\nemergencies.\nLong before the initial 1917 enactment of the Trading\nwith the Enemy Act, which was IEEPA’s predecessor, the\nPresident possessed inherent wartime authority to prohibit\ncommercial relations with enemy nations. That inherent\nauthority included the power to impose tariffs on foreign\nimports.\nFor example, during the Mexican-American War in the\n1840s, President Polk permitted only limited trade with\nMexico, subject to tariffs. Some Members of Congress\npublicly questioned whether the President possessed that\ntariff authority. In response, President Polk justified the\ntariffs on the ground that “the military right to exclude\ncommerce altogether from the ports of the enemy in our\nmilitary occupation included the minor right of admitting it\nunder prescribed conditions.” J. Polk, To the House of\nRepresentatives of the United States (Jan. 2, 1849), in 6\nCompilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents\n2522, 2523 (J. Richardson ed. 1897).\nIn 1854, the Supreme Court agreed with President Polk’s\nview, stating: “No one can doubt” that the President, as\n“commander-in-chief of our naval force,” possessed the\nauthority to “regulate import duties.” Cross v. Harrison, 16\nHow. 164, 189–190.\nIn 1862, President Lincoln partially lifted an existing\nblockade against the Confederate States during the Civil\nWar. Like President Polk, he then permitted limited trade,\nsubject to a monetary fee. A group of cotton sellers later\nsued, arguing that the fee “was essentially a tax and not\nauthorized by any act of Congress, which alone had the\npower to impose taxes.” Hamilton v. Dill"

And to obtain a license, a business may need to pay license fees\nthat can be equivalent to tariffs. See §1702(a)(1).\nTo sum up on the Nixon and Ford tariffs: When enacting\nIEEPA in 1977, Congress employed the exact language\nrecently invoked by President Nixon to justify 10 percent\nworldwide tariffs. And IEEPA came fast on the heels of this\nCourt’s unanimous 1976 decision in Algonquin, which held\nthat substantially similar “adjust the imports” language\nauthorized President Ford’s tariffs on oil imports.\nImportantly, moreover, the statutory provisions\nauthorizing the Nixon and Ford tariffs did not use specific\nwords such as “tariff ” or “duty.”\nThe Nixon and Ford tariffs, this Court’s decision in\nAlgonquin, and the ordinary and historical understanding\nof tariffs as a means of regulating imports together render\nit all but impossible to conclude that Congress in 1977\nimplicitly excluded tariffs when retaining TWEA’s\n“regulate . . . importation” language in IEEPA.

And in 1975, President Ford\ninvoked authority to “adjust the imports” in order to\nsimilarly impose monetary exactions. In addition—if more\nis needed—Marshall, Story, Madison, and this Court have\nall long recognized that the power to regulate foreign\ncommerce includes tariffs.\nThe current President’s reading of IEEPA follows from\nand is entirely consistent with those past interpretations—\nmaking his position nothing like, for example, FDA’s when\nit changed its longstanding position that it lacked the\nauthority to regulate cigarettes, Brown & Williamson, 529\nU.

The fact that recent Presidents have\nnot often had occasion under the National Emergencies Act to declare\nnational emergencies in which tariffs would help “deal with” the specific\nemergency at issue does not mean that Presidents have now lost the\nauthority exercised by President Nixon to impose tariffs.

For any President could then es-\ncape the rigors of those laws—could put in place, say, a non-\ntime-limited 100% tariff on all foreign products—by the\nsimple expedient of identifying a foreign threat. That gut-\nting of Title 19’s tariff scheme is not what Congress, when\ndelegating power to “regulate” imports, could have meant\nto accomplish.\nNor has any President until now understood IEEPA to\nauthorize imposing tariffs. Between 1977 (when IEEPA\nwas enacted) and 2024, eight Presidents had the chance to\nmake use of IEEPA’s delegation of power. And all chose the\nsame course. They invoked the statute’s “regulate importa-\ntion” provision for a variety of non-tariff purposes. See ante,\nat 10. But they looked elsewhere—to Title 19’s provisions—\nfor tariff authority. See ante, at 10–11. In other words,\neach President read the statutes as Congress wrote them,\nwith IEEPA enabling him to regulate imports and Title 19\nenabling him—in confined situations—to tax those foreign\ngoods. None, as far as anyone has suggested, even consid-\nered doing otherwise.3\nFor all those reasons, straight-up statutory construction\nresolves this case for me; I need no major-questions thumb\non the interpretive scales. IEEPA gives the President sig-\nnificant authority over transactions involving foreign prop-\nerty, including the importation of goods. But in that gener-\nous delegation, one power is co"

In foreign affairs cases, courts read the statute as\nwritten and do not employ the major questions doctrine as\na thumb on the scale against the President.\nAlthough I firmly disagree with the Court’s holding\ntoday, the decision might not substantially constrain a\nPresident’s ability to order tariffs going forward. That is\nbecause numerous other federal statutes authorize the\nPresident to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not\nall) of the tariffs at issue in this case—albeit perhaps with\na few additional procedural steps that IEEPA, as an\nemergency statute, does not require. Those statutes\ninclude, for example, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962\n(Section 232); the Trade Act of 1974 (Sections 122, 201, and\n301); and the Tariff Act of 1930 (Section 338).

The Court’s decision\ncould generate uncertainty regarding those trade\narrangements.\nIn any event, the only issue before the Court today is one\nof law.

We also know as much because of tariffs imposed\nby two Presidents and approved by federal courts, including\nthe Supreme Court, in the years shortly before IEEPA’s\n1977 enactment.\nFirst, in 1971, President Nixon imposed 10 percent tariffs\nacross the board on virtually all imports from every country\nin the world.

And Congress’s pattern of usage is plain:\nWhen Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly\nand with careful constraints. It did neither in IEEPA.\nSecond, the argument that “regulate” naturally includes tariffs be-\ncause the term lies between two poles in IEEPA—“compel” on the af-\nfirmative end and “prohibit” on the negative end—is unavailing. Alt-\nhough tariffs may be less extreme than an outright compulsion or\nprohibition, it does not follow that tariffs lie on the spectrum between\nthose poles; they are different in kind, not degree, from the other au-\nthorities in IEEPA. Tariffs operate directly on domestic importers to\nraise revenue for the Treasury and are “very clear[ly] . . . a branch of\nthe taxing power.” Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 201. Thus, they fall outside\nthe spectrum entirely.\nThird, the argument based on IEEPA’s predecessor, the Trading\nwith the Enemy Act (TWEA), and the Court of Customs and Patent\nAppeals’ decision in United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F. 2d 560,\ncannot bear the weight placed on it. A single, expressly limited opinion\nfrom a specialized intermediate appellate court does not establish a\nwell-settled meaning that the Court can assume Congress incorpo-\nrated into IEEPA.\nFourth, the historical argument based on the Court’s wartime prec-\nedents fails. Those precedents are facially inapposite, as all agree the\nPresident lacks inherent peacetime authority to impose tariffs. And\nthe attenuated chain of inferences from wartime precedents through\nmultiple iterations of TWEA to IEEPA cannot support—much less\nclearly support—a reading of IEEPA that includes the distinct power\nto impose tariffs.\nFinally, arguments relying on this Court’s precedents lack merit.\nFederal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U. S. 548,\nbears little on the meaning of IEEPA. Section 232(b) of the Trade Ex-\npansion Act of 1962 contains sweeping, d"

I agree with that conclusion, as I do\nwith the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning. But be-\ncause I think the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation\namply support today’s result, I do not join the part of that\nopinion invoking the so-called major-questions doctrine.\nThe question that part asks, similar to the one posed in\nother “‘major questions’ cases,” is whether the President\ncan identify “clear congressional authorization” for his ac-\ntion—here, to impose tariffs under IEEPA. Ante, at 7, 13,\n20. The demand is for a clear statement—something more\nexplicit or specific than the statutory basis that would ordi-\nnarily suffice to support executive action.

The reason for\nthat requirement, according to today’s opinion, is that the\nExecutive has claimed an “extraordinary” power—one\nnever asserted before and having large-scale “economic and\npolitical significance.” Ante, at 7, 11; see ante, at 7–11.\nI objected, in the principal cases cited, to the demand for\na special brand of legislative clarity.

The\nquestion is what Members of Congress and the public would\nhave understood “regulate . . . importation” to mean when\nCongress enacted IEEPA in 1977. See New Prime Inc. v.\nOliveira, 586 U.
