    {
      "claim": "The Section 122 tariffs are more clearly illegal than the IEEPA tariffs because the statutory precondition — a large and serious balance-of-payments deficit — does not exist.",
      "support_type": "textual"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Trump conflates the balance of trade with the balance of payments, which are distinct economic concepts; the U.S. has no overall balance-of-payments deficit.",
      "support_type": "economic"
    },

      "claim": "Section 122 was enacted to address a specific historical crisis under the Bretton Woods system and those conditions no longer obtain in the modern floating-dollar economy.",
      "support_type": "historical"

    {
      "claim": "The president has no inherent tariff authority and must meet the statutory preconditions Congress set in Section 122, which he cannot satisfy.",
      "support_type": "textual"
    },
    {
      "claim": "Congressional Republicans are derelict in exercising oversight of executive tariff abuse because they only care about rule of law when Democrats hold the White House.",

      "note": "Escalation framing — positions Section 122 as worse legal ground than IEEPA"
    }

  "assumptions": [
    "The statutory text of Section 122 must be read narrowly against its Bretton Woods historical context",
    "Balance of payments and balance of trade are legally distinct concepts that courts will enforce",
    "The dollar's reserve currency status and strong capital inflows definitively negate any balance-of-payments crisis claim",
    "Congressional dereliction does not expand executive power — the constitutional structure still constrains",
    "The Court's IEEPA ruling establishes a framework that makes Section 122 tariffs even harder to defend"
  ],
  "tensions_or_flags": [
    "Assumes courts will apply the same skepticism to Section 122 as to IEEPA, but Section 122 has never been litigated in this context",
    "Does not engage with possible executive arguments that modern trade deficits constitute balance-of-payments problems under a broader reading",
    "Treats congressional inaction as pure dereliction rather than considering it as implicit tolerance of executive trade action",
    "Strong normative framing (presidential attacks are 'unmitigated disgrace') may reduce analytical weight of legal claims"
  ],
  "questions_for_cross_analysis": [
    "Does the statutory text of 19 U.S.C. § 2132 actually distinguish between trade deficits and balance-of-payments deficits?",
    "Did any justices in Learning Resources address Section 122 as an alternative statutory basis?",
    "What is the actual current U.S. balance-of-payments position according to BEA data?",
    "Does the 150-day / 15% cap in Section 122 affect the legal analysis differently than IEEPA's open-ended authority?"
